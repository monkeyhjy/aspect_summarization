positive:
"the ci developer has added jvm command line parameters of /code_segment/ into teamcity but when we run from teamcity it will run every single feature, not just the @automatedtpos ones which we were hoping for."
"in future/topic branches, unlike gitversion, script uses always growing build counter from teamcity, instead of commits counter."
negative:
"because teamcity is putting double-quotes around the /code_segment/ parameter, msbuild does n't recognise this and thinks that multiple project files are being supplied, so it exits."
"currently i have a common database used for component tests in xunit, the problem is that when a build is running on teamcity other builds cannot start as while one build is being run a number of tests are being executed which take quite some time."
