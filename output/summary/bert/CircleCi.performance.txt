"alternatively, if you do n't have frequent builds, you can create a circleci scheduled workflow that runs once an hour with a single job of pruning old k8s pods."
i 'm currently thinking about this solution /url/ for the circleci to not run multiple parallel deployments.
negative:
"it looks like you have some performances issues, and it will be hard to build your application in a ci platform (gitlabci, circleci, etc) because they limit the build time or the performances."
"initially i thought on creating a step in my ci/cd pipeline to run the script, however, circleci wo n't be able to connect to my postgresql pod, since it 's not reachable from outside."
