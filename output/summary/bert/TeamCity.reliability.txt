positive:
i can see (in the teamcity build logs) that these extra files/folders are created by msbuild (15.3.409.57025) but only after it has prepared the octopack.
in teamcity i can set direct dependency and so when i manually trigger toolssuite it able to see if commonlib was changed or no and rebuild if needed.
"as mentioned above, this works absolutely fine from the server - i 've even tried running it from the .cmd file that teamcity created and there are no problems whatsoever."
negative:
"but when i deploy it via teamcity, it gives this error and stops the whole app."
"with the latest teamcity version (2019.1.2), i am unable to see the feedservice.svc properly and this is causing me errors."
