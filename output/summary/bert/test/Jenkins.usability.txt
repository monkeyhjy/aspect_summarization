positive:
on the other hand, using /code_segment/ is not the recommended way of initializing objects in the jenkins pipeline.
i also faced similar issue when configuring git in jenkins.
negative:
i 'm trying to find jenkins pipeline feature in ucd where deployment is automated without any click.
a solution was proposed and integrated in jenkins.war since weekly   release 2.55 (and not yet in any lts to date) which enables the   administrator to configure which function signatures should be used   for each function known to have different variants, apply it to their   application server initialization options and then run and update the   generic jenkins.war without further workarounds.
