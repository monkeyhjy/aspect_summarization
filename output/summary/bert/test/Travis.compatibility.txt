positive:
i am using appveyor (think travis but for windows) to run some tests again several different versions of python.
since a few days travis does not support the jdk option oraclejdk10 anymore.
what worked was to use pyenv, but on the ubuntu xenial dist provided by travis, the shipped version of pyenv was too old and did n't have python 3.7 available.
negative:
/pre/  the code runs successful on different machines, python3.x versions and travis.
i personally use travis to test my software hosted on github and it supports running on multiple architectures [1], including s390x which is big endian.
