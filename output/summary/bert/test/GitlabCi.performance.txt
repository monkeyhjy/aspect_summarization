positive:
it looks like you have some performances issues, and it will be hard to build your application in a ci platform (gitlabci, circleci, etc) because they limit the build time or the performances.
/pre/  the good part is that ci integration works fine, however i must integrate more changes to the dockerfile (and steps to my gitlabci pipeline) and it is a pain to commit and wait the hub to build the image and then force a job to be run in gitlabci -  .
i 've setup a gitlab runner and created my .gitlabci.yml and it all worked, but very slow.
my gitlabci job(docker build with downloading a big file 1.5gb and extracting it with 7zip to 4.6gb) is broken with 137 error.
however with all these steps, i noticed that gitlabci will pull docker image every time the new stages begin.
