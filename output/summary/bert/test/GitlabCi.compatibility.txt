positive:
environment: the build failed in gitlabci environment, running the build inside a docker container.
but i got stuck when i deploy the application using gitlabci where it seems that mongo server does n't start at test environment on gitlab runner.
negative:
script is executing in gitlabci linux runner, image based on golang and works fine without extension.
i have configured .gitlabci.yml file, and using ci lint it has passed the validation process.
