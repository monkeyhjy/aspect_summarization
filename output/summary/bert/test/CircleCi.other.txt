positive:
trying to run build on circleci and it 's failing on test.
i do n't understand how to write my circleci configuration file : /url/ .
unfortunately, we are stuck using two ci/cd systems circleci and jenkins,
i failed to find a solution to it in circleci, azure-pipeline, code-fresh and more.. .
negative:
as part of this commit i got the corresponding circleci build working properly.
there are many possible tools you could use to implement such a pipeline, like circleci, concourse, and aws codepipeline/codebuild/codedeploy.
