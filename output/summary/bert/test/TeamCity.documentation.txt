positive:
i could n't find any information on how to do this for  reports generated in teamcity.
firstly you right teamcity documentation is not clear.
negative:
i 've been learning teamcity the last couple of weeks and have had some good success (fun!).
the documentation of teamcity explains how to download builded artifacts by using the tag version.
