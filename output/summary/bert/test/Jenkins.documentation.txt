positive:
i could find no reference to /code_segment/ in the jenkins documentation, so i created a build to try to clarify their relationship.
i 'm fairly new to jenkins so i guess i 've misunderstood how this works and would appreciate some guidance, with examples if you have the time.
negative:
this stackoverflow page can help you checkout bitbucket pull requests in jenkins with generic webhook trigger.
for the moment, i just want to know the job name and number, things you can easily see from looking at the node information on jenkins' main page.
