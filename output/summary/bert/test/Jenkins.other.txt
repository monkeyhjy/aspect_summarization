positive:
i am currently setting up a ci-pipeline with jenkins/sonarqube/maven/owasp, but im stuck in a sonarqube problem.
but no build is triggered on jenkins.
negative:
there is also a "fork" of jenkins for containerized environments, that i like, you can check more about jenkins-x here .
when i log into the jenkins build server directly and run from bash this works.
