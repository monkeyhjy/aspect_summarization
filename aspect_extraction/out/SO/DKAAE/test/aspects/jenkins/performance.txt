I 'd like to have both my Jenkins environments modify a single URL in each of the python test scripts via some kind of global variable set from within Jenkins so that after the test scripts are pulled from git it modifies that single line in each script and proceeds to run the tests with the appropriate URL parameter given.
Is there a shell script that I can write and add to the Jenkins pipeline that will modify the variable in each script before it gets run on Jenkins?
Set an environment variable in your jenkins configuration, use the environment variable in your test scripts.
I have the same problem at the moment, I think it might be a limitation of the Groovy interpreter on Jenkins, similar to how the each loop did n't work /url/.
Is there a way to group post conditions in a Jenkins declarative pipeline ?

How do I get a FreeStyleProject parameters using groovy and Jenkins script?
I have a string parameter called VERSION which is set to example - 0000 Below is what i am trying in groovy pipeline in jenkins .
If i 'm not wrong, Jenkins has 3 builders per slave for default, so probably the 2 projects would run at the same time.
That way I could create another Jenkins job which generates this image, and this job would only be executed if there are significant changes to the libraries.
/pre/  There is also a Jenkins plugin Test Results Analyzer.
The problem here is that the job you are trying to run concurrently has the same shared workspace, once you overcome that hurdle, you can run as many jobs as you 'd like concurrently (per Jenkins executors limit - which can be controlled from Jenkins settings).
I have Jenkins with several hundreds of jobs, and I need to find job which runs specified gradle task.
Type in "jenkins --httpPort=9898" or whatever port is desired to start Jenkins.
I will do a jenkins pipeline with all together and I will start different stages sequentially like: Stages: .
My goal with all this is to be able to submit a program to Jenkins, and it will compile the program, run some tests, and then restart but this time with different compiler settings.
I have Jenkins Pipeline jobs, where the only difference between the jobs is a parameter, a single "name" value, I could even use the multibranch job name (though not what it 's passing as JOB_NAME which is the BRANCH name, sadly none of the envs look suitable without parsing).

Which is the safest and stable way to run Jenkins on a CI server /code/  .
Is there any advantage of using Maven over Ant for a (Non JAVA) CI/CD implementation where most of the tasks are executed by an .exe with some parameters and the same task would be invoked from Jenkins.
The second step is run directly on a Jenkins slave, can be other slave than the slave which ran the first step.
Jenkins evenly distributes the jobs when multiple jobs have same pattern that trigger at same time.
I need to execute shell commands from Jenkins in windows slave  .
I need to execute an adb command on my master Jenkins node on Mac OS.
Often when looking at scripted jenkins pipeline code, I see this pattern... .
Jenkins writes this command line into a temporary created batch file and executes this batch file with /code/.
/pre/  In other words you have to use /code/ instead of /code/ as this command line is executed by Jenkins by writing this line (and others) into a batch file and execute it with Windows command interpreter.
OR, Other way around it, I can pass it as Password passing parameter for my jenkins job but I am not getting a way to fetch this password in my java program.
I have a Jenkins pipeline job, which in turn starts dynamically several other pipeline jobs in parallel.
Is there a Jenkins REST API that I can call to provide the stage with input parameters and resume the build.
Side Note: I am using this sample function below to fire Build of my project in Jenkins Server.
After system restart where Jenkins is stored, one of the jobs is constantly failing it is trying to create bulid with number 1 but there is already 1400 past builds.
I want Jenkins to run "Execute Windows batch command"  /url/ .
These rows will be used in next build step so that I want to save these to my Jenkins environment variables.
But after i read the pom, assigned it to some global variable it will reset to original value in groovy jenkins script.

/pre/  Is it possible to set the above parameters from Jenkins job?
You could simply add a /url/ task which will queue a job on a Jenkins sever in TFS build definition.
Further, a tool like jenkins ( /url/ ) could call these scripts, and be used for test / deployment from a QA server to your staging host ...ok, you can see how things can slowly move from "small script" to "deployment pipeline" -- the key is keep each step simple, documented, and build it out slowly.

Jenkins is running on OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM, verion 2.73.3. .
what you can do, is inside your script file, change it to take parameters,  after that, in you job, you can add a parameters, to be filled by the Jenkins form like "Build with parameters"  .
If you want to use complex config than your approach is ok and you can execute shell to insert params from jenkins to a file simply by echoing them and then start your script: /url/ .
PHP application will take the input by REQUEST method and then call the Jenkins job .

I have a large number of Jenkins job definitions in Job DSL that all rely on some common functionality that I implemented in helper classes.
I have a couple of bash scripts running on Jenkins which return /code/ and /code/ exit codes depending on their outcome and the Jenkins job shows as green and red, respectively.
In there, I run the following shell script lines which use my Jenkins server 's REST API in combination with a Python one-liner (you could also use /code/ or something else for this) to determine the status of the current build as well as of the last completed build: .
/pre/  lets say that your code is anywhere else.. bamboo or Jenkins for example... there is a ruby/chef resource for it or some way to call it using strait ruby code.
They might not be shown in the GUI though, at least for me with Jenkins 2.73.2.

I am using Jenkins v2.73.2 and wanted to pass a String parameter from one job (TEST_JOB) to another job (BUILD_JOB) using pipeline script feature.
So far my plan is to run a Jenkins master on a VM running Windows Server 2012 (I 've looked at Docker but for now I 'm not using this in our setup).
Our workaround for the moment:  Since both systems are running in Docker containers, we submit from Jenkins by passing it to the IP address of the Sonarqube container.

Could someone point out the mistake in this or is there some other approach that I can use to make HTTP Request from Jenkins Pipeline Job?
The two approaches I can think of are : 1) Use a different jenkins file in each branch 2) Use a series of when {branch 'X'} blocks in the jenkins file .
The second approach is pretty messy but does mean I can use just one Jenkins file.
/pre/  Then, to display the result I used a /code/ task and I obtain such result, after running under Jenkins: .
/pre/  Of the listed code-based approaches to importing a Pipeline shared library, the approach I utilized above seemed to be the only one that actually works with the standard Jenkins Pipeline plugin set, so that was the approach I took.

Executing a bash script /code/ from Jenkins Groovy script and trying to shoot mail depending upon the exit code generated form the bash script.
A lesson learned is to make sure that Jenkins has the ability to read every file which it needs to function.
/pre/  Is there a Singleton pattern that that works in Jenkins Shared Library, or a way to reference an instance across vars files or steps?
I have a Job wich runs every hours, from a Master(Jenkins on Ubuntu) to windows-10 machine as slave, 30-40 % of the time job just fails with following error.
I have simple parallel pipeline (see code) which I use together with Jenkins 2.89.2.
I have a Jenkins pipeline with multiple stages that all require the same environment variables, I run this like so: .
I think it may sense to separate into different repositories and have different jenkins jobs for each one.
When I execute this script by hand, without Jenkins, it works just fine.
Jenkins runs on Windows Server 2012 behind IIS; shell scripts are executed by bash shipped with git for Windows.
I am guessing that it is trying to set some internal variable of Jenkins as the parameter name is matching with it.
Make sure that the user running the jenkins process/service have ant.bat in PATH.
What OS is jenkins hosted on (I am assuming windows since you are looking for ant.bat) and how are you trying to invoke ant in the job.
Regardless this needs to be something that can be run like a script through Jenkins to help with our git cleanup needs.
There might be some plugin, which actually does this, but Jenkins in general just executes commands.
I just need the test to free up the console so my Jenkins work can finish.
In details, it would be something like after every /code/ / /code/ / etc..., the Jenkins job would run the /code/ and /code/ commands and output a result which would allow the /code/ / /code/ / /code/ if the tests pass.
1/ Ensure your path is correct, and no quote/double quote escaping occurs in the process of jenkins job starting.
jenkins: 2.89.2 , os: windows 2012 R2, java: jdk1.8.0_151 .
The biggest thing is to make sure the CIDR block ranges do not overlap and you 'll have to set the security groups on each RDS instance to allow traffic from the Jenkins instance in the  'shared services' VPC .
Jenkins returns a .
We have Ubuntu Jenkins server that runs jobs on Windows slave nodes.
When I turned to use jenkins pipeline script with same batch commands, it 's not as expected -- the process which should contain /code/ was never spawned.
The reason I want to have jar starts running in another process is that it could release current jenkins build to following steps.
As long as I can spawn up the java process from batch command in jenkins pipeline (better with no parent process), I would be really grateful.
However, for Pipeline projects Jenkins for some reason does not actually evaluate and replace the $PATH variable in the variable you 've set.
I need to query two databases from Jenkins to compare the returned results.
However, as I understand, this opens completely new Powershell window/console and the next commands that I typed in Powershell Jenkins build step will be still executed in previous Powershell console, not the one with different user.
In my jenkins pipeline, I historically have invoked curl from the command line to make http requests, and I 'm looking to streamline it.
This is happening with the jenkins image on Docker version 17.12.0-ce, build c97c6d6 on Windows 10 Professional.
There are (at the time of writing) a few different ways to register a Shared Library with a Jenkins instance.
I have Jenkins Scripted Pipeline and I need to get Parent Build Number.
I have a jenkins pipeline to do parallel processing like below .
I 'm working on a busy Jenkins server with many big matrix jobs being built all the time.
I want Jenkins jobs to run exclusively on a server to measure CPU performance.
I 've a Jenkins pipeline that should evaluate a boolean parameter called /code/: .
If I call this method jenkins performs as expected.
Jenkins console output from jobs running py.test tests contains unexpected characters "[1m" "[0m" like .
Since the source cannot be compiled, jenkins is not aware of any /code/ block anyway.
I want to list my branches as parameter in Jenkins.
But when I try to apply this program to run in Jenkins every hour.
To take care of this I have implemented shell command to copy the text file to another place in Jenkins after every execution and copying it back before the next execution starts.
If you want to access the /code/ from Jenkins environment variable as a shell script, use the below snippet.
Jenkins master machine CPU, RAM and hard disk usage.
Every time Jenkins is restarted OR a user tries to log-in for the first time, the first log-in takes 3-5 minutes.
Basically, i want to run my script thru Jenkins and do not want to use a path which points to my machine.
the java.exe process is necessary for Jenkins service, so I ca n't end it.
In Jenkins you can build a job periodically by defining a cron like syntax with the addition of /code/(for "hash").
i can get the jenkins Build Duration using the Rest API via curl , but the time is in milliseconds.
What you can do is to have both parameters displayed in the job and then just use a simple if statement in your Jenkins pipeline to ignore para2 in case para1 value is no.
If I run the same script on local (not via Jenkins), then the browser size would be (1554, 843) and hence the reason script is getting failed as it 's not able to find the element id.
From the technical details of job 1, we have our WinVM nodes named with the WIN prefix, so to get all Windows nodes, we query Jenkins via the /url/.
Second question is still actual: how to run my gtests and record results in Jenkins after the make command works?
So general conclusion: As it looks like there is no any make plugin for jenkins, the pipeline stages can run a batchfile (or shell script for UNIX), and this batchfile can call make.
In a Jenkins job, I have a groovy script, that is split in two parts.
you can pass these variables as the Jenkins Job 's parameters.
The Jenkins job is successfully able to clone the git code to the work space.
/pre/  I executed docker run command to start the Jenkins from my new image.
I have a jenkins job which runs for 15 to 30 minutes.
I cannot find much help online and found /url/ and it seems jenkins currently support just String description String type = 'TAG' String branch String tagFilter String sortMode = 'NONE' String defaultValue  .
Each time a build job is started due to a change on a branch in Git, Jenkins apparently pick a random free build node with a fresh, clean workspace meaning no incremental build speedup.
Is there anyway to make Jenkins choose the node a little less randomly and prefer the latest node on which the branch was build the last time?
What is the trick to get environment variables to propagate to jenkins shared library src class execution?
Having said that, the script you are running within Jenkins you may also want to run locally.
I 've tried this solution, to force jenkins to run with https but it didnt work: /url/ .
I am running Jenkins on Windows Server 2016.
Here is what i tried so far jenkins timestamp is /code/ which translates to current date /code/ .
since jenkins timestamp is in miliseconds, so i divided the timestamp by 1000 and then ran .
Here is an example that works on my Jenkins 2.85 .
I 've tried to tell the Jenkins interpreter that /code/ is n't a Jenkinsfile environment variable by escaping the dollar sign prefix like this: .
I think this is an issue with my being inside of a string block (the /code/) syntax, and also telling Jenkins not to try to get the value of /code/ out of the /code/ collection.
Anyway, I 'm not having much luck googling for the solution to this problem, because Jenkins' pipelines have their own notion of environment variables that seem to be separate from bash environment variables.
You can already stop jobs in Jenkins if two copies of the same job are running.
I have my local system as a Jenkins Master and Every time I need A slave to run my automation test script , a docker container spins up as a Jenkins slave and my script is executed on the slave and after the execution is completed the container is destroyed .
   Is it possible with some other plugin or existing Jenkins functionality to check; If there are two tests and both have the same sha1 environment variable, stop the first test and build the newest test instead?
1) The only way to stop the instance seem to be to abort the build in jenkins whiсh leads to the exit code 143 and build marked as red instead of green .
The problem that I encountered was that all the python scripts in the free-style Jenkins jobs now do nothing.
Create 3 parameters in your Jenkins (one for your branch: /code/, /code/ or /code/), and one for the desired version, and one for your NEXT version.
It is strange while I want to use Multi-line String Parameter in Jenkins job.

I have created selenium testng.xml file and make windows batch file for my local window machine and Jenkins build now function perfectly working .
Removes inherited environment variables by the Jenkins Java process .
/pre/  Also here /code/ say to exit once one container defined into docker-compose-jenkins.yml exits, and /code/ says to take exit code from idealoifapi image.
I want after checking script#1 job could exit and directly jenkins job status should be "pass" .
I have a Jenkins pipeline job that (among other things) creates another pipelineJob (to cleanup everything afterwards) using /url/.
I want to add 'Execute python script' as a step in jenkins job.

The tee bit is some workaround to avoid Jenkins halting if the output of the pep8 command is non-zero.
/pre/  Tested both cases and work on Jenkins 2.89.4 .
Jenkins Git Plugin sets /code/ environment variable with Git commit SHA1 id which is 40 characters long.
I want to set some aliases in a node where my jenkins job runs.
I 'm trying to write the Jenkins Hash (/url/) in Scala.
My .bat is now executable inside ksh/mksh, which is necessary since I 'm running a Jenkins job that calls a Korn shell stack 3 files deep, that I have no modifiable control over.
My goal is to run my first time Selenium tests with Jenkins (not local).
To solve the problem, it 's important to understand that Jenkins is inside a container and when the docker agent inside this container talk to your docker engine, it give path to mount volume matching inner the container.
You have at first to get the last successful build from Jenkins for given job: .
You need to make sure that any non-zero exit codes are propagated to Jenkins.
S.O: Windows Server 2012 R2 Jenkins 2.89.3 Java Updated .
Setup a cron for Jenkins user every 15 mins - .
For example, if I have an image created in dev as test:10 (10 is the build number generated by jenkins).
Also, it would be great if anyone can let me know as to how can i fail Jenkins Serenity BDD job based on a threshold (i.e.
It 's intended that the builds can be paused at those stages if there 's heavy activity on the jenkins instance, but they should continue when executors are available.
By default, jenkins does n't support running single job on multiple nodes simultaneously.
Where they are passing the Jenkins made "environment variables" via the Parameterized Trigger Plugin, however, these are variables that are predefined in Jenkins.
I want to add 2 different time in shell script but i am not sure how to do it The scenario is to get the build start time , build end time and build execution time of a jenkins build.
But when i try to add the below expression in Jenkins job configuration -> Label Expression, it not accepting two nodes.
I am trying to call jenkins job from python script.
In a multibranch Jenkins job, you can decide to show health metrics and they are obtained from the branch with the worse health.
The whole process I was running it through jenkins job.
It 's a bit hard if I 'm doing it with random number that is hard to retrieve when the Jenkins job is done.
And two Jenkins Jobs job1 for first path and job2 for second path.
Here is one way to achieve this in jenkins (my point 2).
Add this script and run (as first) Job-1 jenkins  .
we need to specify a new context path because we already have an instance of jenkins in ./Jenkins, so we try to use the parameter --prefix=/jenkins2/ in order to have the 2 instances separated.
So Jenkins is doing two scripts, called by two separated processes.
Probably yours is not working because the "/" in the end "/jenkins2/" .
i have defined execute shell in jenkins that will delimiter the artifacts values into 2 parts (f1:f2) so that those variable values i can define into tag to acknowledge the version but it didnt work.
(Note: $COMPONENT,$DTR,$REPO,$APP_COMPONENT, $ENVIRONMENT is string parameter in jenkins where i define hardcoded valued during build time" .
Defining a variable as /code/ makes Jenkins assign it a true value but defining it as /code/ assign it the real false value .
Does anyone happen to know how to run a declarative jenkins pipeline where one of the stages is ran on multiple agent labels in parallel?
How to create a project in Jenkins to run Job-2 after 10hrs from Job-1 completion time.Job-2 should take the same parameter input from Job-1?
Some folks do run CI (such as Jenkins) in their Kubernetes clusters, and it is a legitimate approach, however, this means you have more things to run, and cut your self out from all the hosted CI options out there.
Long story short, Jenkins kills all processes spawned by a job once that job finishes.
In Jenkins pipeline code we can set environment variables and use them later as parameters when executing different stages: .
I place the script in Jenkins' /url/ directory to trigger it on every start.
But I would like to run my tests from prompt in order to execute my suite from Jenkins in the future... .
/pre/  When Jenkins job is triggered we need to call that /code/, get the value of the /code/ and set it as a parameter VERSION for the build.
It 's a side effect of TCL interpreter integration in Jenkins: I guess there 's a hidden layer that parses the script and modify it according to non-TCL syntax.
I have a job with SVN branch as parameter ("List subversion tags and more") and try to use jenkins environment variable into SVN URL like : /url/$JOB_NAME  .
When I try to build my Jenkins pipeline, there is one test step which always fails.
Inside a Jenkins file - you can set to execute a  'shell' script.
But when trying to deploy it using jenkins it shows Timeout waiting for async operations eventhough my wait time in the scope is 15 mins.
I do not want this to happen always... that means I want to choose the node only when I wish...and most of the other times Jenkins should route the job to any available/free node.
This command works well also in the Jenkins container.
From jenkins, make sure there is a machine where the selenium tests can run.
First 3 steps should be done in your CI machine (for example, as a jenkins job).
Our first proof of concept is trying to get a jenkins (or even just httpd!)
I try to undeploy from jenkins to weblogic servers and my scripts is java -cp D:\Jenkins\additional\wlfullclient.jar weblogic.Deployer -debug -remote -verbose -undeploy -name MTS -appversion 4.5.9.0.5 -targets MTS-APP-01,MTS-JOB-01,MTSWS-APP-01,MTSWS-APP-02  -adminurl t3://100.115.35.14:7001 -user * -password * .
If this option is checked, Jenkins will schedule and execute multiple   builds concurrently (provided that you have sufficient executors and   incoming build requests.)
For other kinds of jobs, allowing concurrent executions of multiple   builds may be problematic, for example if it assumes a monopoly on a   certain resource, like database, or for jobs where you use Jenkins as   a cron replacement.
However, this will not trigger Jenkins to start a job immediately.
Actually, I was able to run Jenkins Linux container on my Windows (Build 1709)  machine.
Is there a way to have it return a non-zero exit code so Jenkins knows that it failed?
I was facing same issue with jenkins ssh slave '/url/', however my case was bit complicated because it was necessary to pass an argument which contained spaces.
/pre/  I would like to get the value for a key where the key is a parameter of the Jenkins job that runs this Groovy script.
What if the program need to be triggered periodically by Jenkins?
That is harder to dump into your Jenkins log - the  'reg' command would do it, but it will take you a number of tries to get everything you need.
/pre/  0 S jenkins   5670     1 93  80   0 - 2791171 futex_ 11:19 ?
In Jenkins global configuration I have a Throttle category called justin_trunk that has the label justin_trunk associated with it that is supposed to limit nodes to one concurrent run.
I found that the last two lines 'expect eof ... wait' were needed for it work in Jenkins.
/pre/  Note: It is best practice to not put the expect script inside a jenkins node.
Jmeter - Selenium webdriver sampler is not running when the JMeter Test is run thru Jenkins job, but the Selenium Webdriver sampler is running fine when running the test from JMeter instance.
running /code/ lists bucket files; running the same command into Jenkins' Script Console yelds a 403).
Second, it is always better to have some visibility on build results in Jenkins itself.
I am trying to run a single node Jenkins with: .
Jenkins jobs running in the same container (single node) .
/pre/  However, this overwrites the parameter definitions, so if the user had specified a different parameter definition in their jenkins file before invoking our groovy, it 's been wiped out.
As a workaround to current performance plugin limitations you can consider running JMeter using /url/ tool as a wrapper, it has flexible and powerful /url/ subsystem which will basically return to Jenkins non-zero exit code triggering build failure in case of issue in the test.
For Example :     I got 192.168.99.100  - using this IP to run the Jenkins like 192.168.99.100:8080  .
/pre/  When I run this via a command line on the machine (with the same user as my Jenkins service), it works fine and runs the script.
I 've tried dumping the environmental variables with /code/ in both instances, and all the environmental variables are the same (except some Jenkins-specific ones).
I am using Jenkins pipeline (Jenkins version - v2.73.2 ,Jenkins pipeline - 2.5) and wanted to force my job to use only two windows slave machines 'Jenkins-s1' or 'Jenkins-s2' which ever is available.
Then execute the first role against localhost and the second one against jenkins_builders: .
Systems such as Jenkins usually are /code/ with the necessary branch, so CI can simply /code/ at this point and load the name of the environment to deploy.
The intermediate job is scheduled at 8am and queries job A using the Jenkins API to find out when it last run and triggers B if it has run in the last 24 hours.
The Jenkins output says it cant find the element however it is there and I have the proper waits.
When I use  wait.until(ExpectedConditions.visibilityOfElementLocated((By.id("DivMyWorkList")))); Jenkins test hangs and times out.
However, this will not trigger Jenkins to start a job immediately.
I use MSBuild 14.0.23107.0, sonarqube 6.7.1.35068, sonar-scanner-msbuild-4.0.2.892, sonar-csharp-plugin-6.7.1.4347, Jenkins 2.89.3 .
In Jenkins you can set a job to build periodically using a cron-like time definition.
My java program outputs a list of email Ids .I need to use the Email Id to email those people through Jenkins when the java program Or that job  executes.
I would like to have this maven job populate the /code/ in the a-version.properties file with the Jenkins job number.
I have a jenkins job that takes a file as an input.
I am trying to run a jenkins job from node js script.
I 'm trying to get some information of my current jenkins instance running jobs in a bash script.
Get Result from PREVIOUS Jenkins job .
def instance = Jenkins.getInstance() .
Basically all works fine, but Jenkins seems to redirect to /code/(without a port) from time to time.
You have many options to restart Jenkins manually, but mainly two (URL or command line): .
There is no limit implicitly within Jenkins.
If you are using jenkins pipeline, ensure that the wait 's do not occur whilst consuming an executor (inside a node block).
Try including the stage closure, so you can see all stages kick-off at once in Jenkins.
Jenkins workspace locations are typically randomised folders based on the job name with a hash/incrementor number in the path, so a Push would be inadvisable.
Since you asked for a Jenkins solution, this is my suggestion: .
All the pipeline code which is not inside a /code/ is executed in a Jenkins master thread and it 's shown in the UI as an executor, usually called lightweight executor.
This is my first Jenkins script, it currently operates well on Linux but I migrate to MacOS (High Sierra) with the result of getting shell script error.
I 'm new to Jenkins but what I have learned so far, that you ca n't fill this fields with environment variables.

You can also use something like a jenkins or a simple cron task that fires the aws-cli command to ECS, in both these cases though you will need an instance always running.
In GOGS case you would call Jenkins via:     /url/ .
All you 're doing is OK, but what you want is not supported by Jenkins whether it is pipeline or not, since the parameters' load is happening prior to the pipeline-flow or the definition of the ${VAR1}.
We execute Jenkins job nightly to perform code analysis using SonarQube.
I am building a project in Jenkins and want to launch tests right after it,  wait   until the tests are finished and than run another job to analyze the results.
You can trigger one Jenkins job from another.
I am running these test cases in VM machine with jenkins.
/pre/  This will list both system and Jenkins variables.
But the build number in Jenkins increased.
I created pipeline job in jenkins that first, creating Template variable with StreamingTemplateEngine object and using it, and secondly, calling sh step.
I know my awk commands can be improved, I 'm not yet sure how, but my primary goal is to get the list of servers dynamically loaded in Jenkins.
I have a 1st Jenkins job which generates some report in the form of HTM (rows and columns).
The sh command in question should run on a jenkins node inside a node block.
PS: If the build number should better be determined by a build server as Jenkins, I would also be glad to hear about that.
Understanding the fact that every time jenkins job run, it clears out the workspace.
I  need a job in Jenkins that every time is running keeps only the last file created in a folder and discard all the older ones.
Is there a way to monitor all the jobs run from one Jenkins server?There is a option for master/slave in Jenkins.
I am literally like 20 minutes into jenkins and do not know a whole lot.
Jenkins has AWS EC2 plugin but it is managing autoscaling on it own and people 's are facing issue even CPU is high when they test with Stress Utility.
I need a Jenkins script that can print out the parameters of the Build running on all remote nodes that have a matching label.
Is it possible to create a view in Jenkins that will only show jobs that have had a successful build in the last 30 days (Last Success &lt;= 30 days)?
I have 100s of Jenkins jobs, each starting and ending at various times.
In groovy (specifically in Jenkins using a pipeline), having this map (from println(mymap)): .
What I would like to happen, is if a conditional statement in my customTest.js file returns a certain value, I fail the jenkins test, exactly as nightwatch would fail a test, and if it does n't return that value, then it passes on to the next post-build steps etc.
Now , my requirement is to run the same script for a choice parameter in jenkins where i can execute using the groovy script.
Does anyone know if you can run a Jenkins' job from JobDSL that has parameters?
8172 port is allowed for Jenkins.
There 's a jenkins job doing also building it and it 's green, so it must be something that 's different on your local machine.
For normal Jenkins job, env variable is set as /code/,  similarly is there any way we can get build number in pipeline?
(i know that  it 's running Jenkins Instance) That 's all what it for?
Jenkins version: 1.657 Server: Windows Server 2012 R2 .
This lists all jobs running on Jenkins in one view.
/pre/  This reduced total iterations from 12960 to 57 (numbers are relative only to my Jenkins of course).
Is there any way to export Octopus variables to json file, using "Command" step in Jenkins?
By clicking that button a subjob is invoked again with the same parameters (plugin queries the jenkins api, get params of this job, and resubmits the subjob).
We see there are 6 users with jobs running in the jenkins queue.
In a Jenkins pipeline, parameters defined in upstream job is not being passed to downstream job even "current build parameters" option is selected.
Since Jenkins keeps track of test results you can step through the history of a particular test case (using the "Previous/Next build" links).
How would I have to configure a job in Jenkins to call some script on a node, the node to execute and when exiting, the job to not declare the build finished but to wait for a certain amount of time and to call again the script.
I cannot access to any Jenkins parameter (ex: /code/ as below) from the scope of /code/.

I 've set in Jenkins to run every hour and run shell commands at post step of the build.
This simple program is currently running on my Jenkins every hour as below.
I understand that Jenkins isolates completely every single execution and should n't have any impact .
Keep in mind that Jenkins Groovy script execution environment is a little bit different than the plain Groovy (e.g.
And finally you can run your JMeter test via /url/ having very powerful and flexible /url/ so if there will be a clash between expected and actual metrics it will basically return non-zero exit code which you can use in shell scripts or Jenkins freestyle jobs and/or pipelines.
/pre/  Update - 2 The npm file extension is .cmd and Windows 10 with Jenkins 2.89.4 .
For ex: I want to make an app to change code coverage threshold values for my Jenkins Jobs.
If you want to stop a long running job, let 's say, it is running more than 3 hours, then below jenkins plugins does exactly that for you.
This ‘stop’ would mean either: -   stop now, meaning placing a file on the node that is supposed to signal the script running there that it needs to gracefully stop the execution and Jenkins to collect whatever results are available at that point -   or stop after the node finishes executing its script entirely, right before the next waiting happens  .
I want to abort my Jenkins Job before clock hits a particular time.
That means that multiple upstream builds might be triggering a single Jenkins test job.

How to access /code/ variable in Jenkins pipeline job?
With the job-dsl there 's a means of testing the DSL code before committing it to SCM: /url/ - this allows a local test suite to be run on DSL code, as well as in Jenkins, before the code is run.
We would like the tests to be completely self-contained so they can be run and finished with no side effects, so they can be run in multiple environments (developer, CI, Jenkins, AWS, etc).
I 'm running a python script from a Jenkins pipeline job, and that python script runs another program that produces a log file whose name differs each run.
There are other options like to have the jenkins pipeline pass extra arguments down to the python script specifying a random log file name, or have the python script return the log file name.
Jenkins 2.89.2 on Ubuntu 16.04 .
Another solution would be to leverage a continuous integration tool such as jenkins or teamcity to automatically schedule runs over a period of time.
Since you require secrets, the best practice way is to use the withCredentials plugin which can load credentials stored in Jenkins credential store and expose them as ENV variables to code executed within its block/closure.
But when run on jenkins, after a fixed number of tests(nearly 14), start giving exceptions.

In this case, the process simply starts the jenkins service and exists.
As per my analysis, Jenkins by default will try to use port number as 8080.
If in Jenkins I try to execute such commands as /code/ or /code/ via ssh, Jenkins finishes with return code -1 even if I add /code/ to the end of these commands.
When running Groovy in the context of Jenkins pipeline job the above answers do not work (at least on version 2.60.2), but the following does: .
Last time I tried to use this image: "gcr.io/cloud-solutions-images/jenkins-k8s-slave" but for me it fails for any image in case I put 'jnlp' as container template name.
Even if you initialize the path with a .bash_profile script, the user under which Jenkins is executing is probably not executing the same initialization script.
Jenkins always puts it to build queue and executes one at a time.
/pre/  Unfortunately, this code functions differently on my local machine and on the Jenkins server.
The reason for your issue is that system Groovy script on Jenkins runs on  'master' node even that your pipeline runs on a node.
you can create a script and copy the command into it, then when jenkins performs the build task, it can execute the script.

Java 1.8 Jenkins 2.89 .
In Jenkins Pipeline, we can declare /code/ inside the entire pipeline or inside a specific /code/ and that 's it.
The point is the inheritance solution is only done in Maven itself but not in Jenkins.
Jenkins will also care for test reports- exactly as it does for unit tests.
Alternatively, is there a possibility that there can be only one job in Jenkins, but gradle has been configured to build project X times in parallel with different parameters?
If you are running the jenkins on windows machine, doing this will do the trick.
I 'm trying to call a remote job from one Jenkins server to another, I have this working fine via a shell script.
Basically merged jacoco-unit.exec and jacoco-it.exec into one binary and published that merged result on Jenkins via pipeline step.

To integrate this solution to my Jenkins jobs I would prefer using a _JAVA_OPTIONS environment variable approach rather than scripts modification.
So is there any possible way for me to run the JMeter scripts in Jenkins.
Is there a way to tell Jenkins "Run this test job for PRs against /code/?"
I checked and confirmed that the jenkins jvm process was running (with /code/ command which displays list of running java processes).
You should really have at least three servers: one for SonarQube, one for the database, and one for Jenkins.

It seems that jenkins check those deleted builds when start jenkins, and cost too much time.
I have a scripted Jenkins pipeline which redistributes building of the codebase to multiple nodes, implemented using a /code/ block wrapped with /code/ block.
I have one Jenkins pipeline job which can run concurrent builds.
However this needs to be done on the Jenkins machine (running Windows 7) as well.
Since my Dockerfile takes a "base image" from jenkins/jenkins:lts-alpine, it creates a volume for /var/jenkins_home/ which seems to be where the jobs are stored at.
Like docker cp jobs-on-my-machine container:/var/jenkins_home/jobs, but I dont want a lot of extra stuff outside my Dockerfile.
I set up Jenkins to run some jobs(It runs 10 minutes) at night.
But Jenkins can only compare the count of warnings to the previous build.
While running this function out from the VS for example command line or Jenkins the XML file does n't update.

I am trying to get Cobertura code coverage results from my Jenkins Job.
If you want to run the scripts on Jenkins master (not recommended, it 's a bottleneck), use the /code/ or /code/ steps.
if so you can try using Jenkins pipeline to run jobs in parallel and trigger job c after 'a' and 'b' is completed.
Following are the commands what i am using to run my angular build successfully from Jenkins.The last command is executed the dirty way by setting up the path variables.
Two possibilities strike me when using parallel processes in Jenkins: .

I am trying to use Jenkins for the first time, but every time a build is run it gives me an error that reads: .
One version to go about it is to ensure from Jenkins that you do n't run the second build until the first one has finished.
You can execute it as script if it is available in your Jenkins instance/slave node (based on where you are running it) .
I have only one jenkins where everything is running .
Is there any plugin in Jenkins for distributing unit tests to slave machines in parallel fashion and returning back the results to the master?
I 'm fairly new to Groovy and Jenkins pipelines and i need a string converted to a map to get some workable data i have n't been able to find a solution so far.
/pre/  The string above is what a certain jenkins choice parameter is returning me in a groovy variable.
When you run the script, you can pass the environment parameter either through maven or jenkins, and then your scripts can pick up correct data based on the environment parameter.
I tried to set the /code/ variable to /code/ when starting Jenkins, but that just caused it to time out in the build.
(I 'm running Python3, Jenkins 2.73.1) .
Note one shortcoming of this approach is that now the Jenkins file does not contain all the necessary information to run the script correctly.
Once the test passes on the develop branch jenkins returns github with green signal to perform actual merge.
It takes a minute or two to reload jenkins 3.

so I managed to get parallel build execution in a Jenkins pipeline running two jobs: "Unit Tests" and "E2E Tests", but the only way I could make it work, is inside a single "Testing" stage as follows: .
And, when I run the project from Jenkins it is running entire test for two times.
For me the problem was that I left the jenkins window unattended for some time.
Depending on how exactly you want to archive your results (sorry I have never used sonar) you could just run /code/ inside Jenkins, and use a reporter to expose the results and do as you wish with them.
Ideally my other jenkins jobs should take up maximum 1 request per minute.
We need an output as JUnit test report for our jenkins jobs.
However, when I incorporate the very same script into a Jenkins build, on the very same machine, the /code/ call in the script on the huge vm fails with: .
So, if you start RF via Jenkins shell execution do something like this: .

There are countless tutorials found with search terms like "creating a freestyle jenkins job" if you need in-depth step-by-step instructions.
I am having some performance problems when I am starting Jenkins inside Kubernetes cluster.
Apparently Jenkins expands the variables /code/ and /code/ differently.
Since we 're using 1 Jenkins scripted pipeline for all repositories and branches, we do not want to check in 1 single Jenkinsfile into 300+ branches that requires updating every branch when we need to perform a change to the pipeline.
Your webhook can query your Jenkins status and return results.
So after the initial build, which works fine, Jenkins never runs the job all the way through again.
Jenkins Installation Ubuntu 14.04/16.01 Please follow the steps given below.
However, the C:\Windows\Temp directory is not writable by Jenkins on my machine, and so the shell script is never written and never executed (apparently).
As a side node, I 'm building the images using Jenkins on Ubuntu 16.04 using /code/ version 197.0.0 .
I 've tried to merge between two branches in the Jenkins, but I did n't get it.
Running something like a Jenkins worker that spawns large numbers of ad hoc jobs involving shells can result in a lot worse.
The CI worker (like Jenkins) example is the first that comes to mind where Java spawns command or shells that spawn other commands.
Every time jenkins jobs starts it call master branch and it runs with no problem and the stages of the pipeline are run.
Thing is that eventhough I specified my branch in in "branch specifier",  jenkins still runs the master branch.
How to input json file as input parameter to jenkins job?
For instance, lets take Jenkins as an example.
Stop your Jenkins instance, close your current command interpreter and start a new one, and launch Jenkins with your command (/code/).

I can run the following command using a command line but when I 'm running it with Jenkins (Windows) it fails: .
/pre/  All you then need to do is execute that regularly (cron job, Jenkins job, ...) and you main repository will always be up to date.
There is already an environment variable in Jenkins that you can use for this purpose.
Instead of running tests in the intermediary stages, I 'd like to run them outside the image so that I can re-order the sequence of tests and add more switches at a Pipeline layer (Jenkins CI, Travis, etc) .
I am using Taurus with Performance plugin to run my Jmeter tests in Jenkins.
Oh, and I know passing in three parameters in the command line would also suffice, but the command line is coming from a Jenkins job and I want to make sure that the users only have to add a single number as a parameter.
I want to pass exactly the same build number to other jenkins jobs(J2 and J3) of a pipeline p1.
Is there any way for me to run my jobs as "ci_user" instead of as "jenkins"?
It looks like in every Jenkins REST request there are two call made over HTTP/HTTPS the first call make appropriate changes are per request and second call confirms whether requested changes are made.

Meaning that every time somebody pushes into a branch, Jenkins runs the job to build that branch.
Since each bug and feature are done in a separate branch - my list of branches in Jenkins project (multi branch pipeline)automatically grows very fast.
You can execute stage 'Release' and 'Prod-Deliver' based on conditional input parameter of your Jenkins pipeline.
I 'm running yarn under a continuous integration server (Jenkins) and the color escape chars pollute the output.
That script can easily be added in a post-build step of a Jenkins job, executed if the previous steps succeed.
I am running the following code when I startup the Jenkins instance: .
I need to pass data from one step to another in a Jenkins pipeline.
Is there any way to call another exe to kill child exe 's in some post build actions in jenkins?
2) you can use any variables you want, Jenkins env variables or any variable you add with the help of "env inject" plugin.
Does Jenkins re-use previous workspace, regardless of executor number?
We can write a icron job if linux or powershell script if windows, which queries a particular s3 bucket for the given string, if it finds then u can trigger the Jenkins job.
/pre/  The above will continue the jenkins build even if robocopy returns non-zero errorlevel.
I am curios if it 's possible to have one computer/node that would be shared between two jenkins instances?
I know that one can make two same copies of node configurations on Jenkins instances and change workspace, but I am aiming for this scenario.
I know that it can be achieved when you have one jenkins instance, but how to do it if you have to use two of them at least?
We have a jenkins job on which we are running some tests using chrome and java.
Once set, if the property file contains "FOO=/path/to/folder" then in configuring Jenkins things you would refer to $FOO or ${FOO} (for example, an Ant build step might specify "${FOO}/build.xml"; in Windows batch script execution FOO shows up as an environment variable and is referenced by %FOO% (i.e., "@echo Some_Useful_Piece_Of_Data > %FOO%\data.txt" .
Binding variables are considered bad practice because if you load multiple scripts (/code/ step) binding variables will be accessible in all those scripts because Jenkins shares the same Binding for all scripts.
anycase, the solution was two separate Jenkins jobs, one for CI (no version increase at all) and other one for Release.
/pre/  I ca n't have Jenkins expand the value of the variable email_body.
I 'm able to run the following shell script but could n't run from Jenkins pipeline code.
I want to know that new node machine or slave pc should have jenkins in it or not?
Disadvantage of environmental variables is that I have to set it correctly on all machines (localhost, codenvy, jenkins ...)  Is there better solution?
Is it possible to get previous build completion time in Jenkins pipeline?
Jenkins sets some environment variables you can read:  /url/ .
I want to run in jenkins a docker image that run a script with nodeJs.
This makes me wonder: If my pipeline and the Jenkins plugins live in the same JVM without any separation, I can never know which version of a specific jar/class will be used and it is very difficult to stably run a pipeline.
I have Jenkins freestyle jobs that successfully invoke msbuild jobs using the VS 2015 tools by declaring environment variable: .
I have attempted to add memory to the environments and also set env variable JENKINS_JAVA_OPTIONS to -Djava.awt.headless=true -Xmx1024m -XX:MaxPermSize=4096m .
In a next stage (not in the pipeline) you can use the file again in a different container or jenkins slave itself.
Perform the stuff and in a later stage you can do your analysis on your code on your jenkins slave itself (without docker) .
/pre/  Need a help on this how to readfile and get output string as a variable in jenkins pipeline so that i can inject to next stage of scripts on jenkinsfile .
I am using jenkins pipeline script to run jmeter script and am using performance plugin to create performanceReport as below .
/pre/  In the below performance trend though errors are increased the build is green so I 'm trying to configure Jenkins performance plugin to fail job if the percentage of errors increase by /code/ or response time decrease/increase by /code/  with respect to previous build(s) .
jenkins data set.. First Item.... [['922',  'sdsadad', 'Test Suite Hook   s', 'Test Suite Hooks', '', '', '2018-05-23 01:00:00', 'pass', 'None',   'None']] .

If you are behind proxy then try to set jenkins proxy variables while starting your docker container.
I know this identifier to be unique for my whole Jenkins installation, so any search by this key should return exactly zero or one job.
Also i want to run the test for 50000 user count.How shall i set heap size for this through jenkins .
I am using groovy to call a python in my Jenkins job.
/pre/  The parameters i need to pass are jenkins build job parameters.
I have a jenkins job which uploads a pretty small bash file(less than &lt;1mb) to s3 bucket.
Have written an ant script to perform PHP Static code analysis on Jenkins its working fine but, its performing on whole Bit-bucket repository.

I am trying to run my angular test-cases on jenkins.
Jenkins 2.107.2 still use Java 8 .
One crude way I can think of is to copy the whole jobs directory to the new Jenkins setup.
Answer in case of Jenkins is definitive no, but here is what you have as an alternative /url/ is the modern it operations management platform in other words it is scheduller with UI wich can a lot of power and if just need to run simple cases one per week it will do that job.
Paste IP along with jenkins port into browser (E.g.-  172.161.46.173/8383) and hit Enter.
But when Jenkins executes it, it looks like it does not recognize the pipe character and it takes it as next line or something.
I 'd like to only run a stage in a Jenkins pipeline (/code/) if the branch matches a specific regular expression (regex).
I have a jenkins single instance running in a docker container.
I want the jenkins run my build inside a docker container but since jenkins is already running inside a docker.
Specifically, how can I get Jenkins to extract the commit hash from the results of the /code/ command in the following very simple Jenkinsfile?
I am using Jenkins (2.107.2) to run a maven test for the first time.
To some extent, running an app inside of a container (in this case Jenkins) is like running it on a separate host.
Alternatively, you can use Jenkins stash to carry the test results to a /code/ stage .
I am trying to iterate through a list to curl each one, this ultimately is to kick of a list of Jenkins jobs.
/pre/  It happens when the environment variable JENKINS_SLAVE_AGENT_PORT is not set.
I have a Jenkins server running v2.107.3, and a Windows agent node.
However, it seems to work nicely on Jenkins 2.73.2.  .
With the second way you do n't  have to worry about inadvertent globbing and the jenkins-list file may  get nicely buffered instead of needing to be read all into memory at once (not that it matters for such a small file but why not have a technique that works well more or less regardless of file size?).
/pre/  If I decrease the node count to two, terraform destroy jenkins node 2 and create a new one (jenkins node 1).
I need to schedule a Jenkins task so it runs once per day, but only if certain other tasks succeed at least once that day.
jenkins@ip-172-31-22-20:~/workspace/TestAngular$ ionic cordova build android .
We have another server which runs pipeline fine however the differences are that this is windows 2012 server and it is running an older version of Jenkins and Java.
/pre/  Jenkins stucks at above statement, and never get out of it.
If we use the Jenkins 'Execute shell' box, we are unable to figure out how to force it to use the Ubuntu bash shell as shebang instruction is ignored on windows slaves (know issue) .
If we use Jenkins 'Execute Windows batch command' box, and run something list this: bash -c ls This works on the local machine, but if run from jenkins on windows slave the job just hangs and we see the spinning gear progress icon, eventually we have to kill the jenkins job.
The bash.exe is located inside C:\Windows\System32 which is already the first entry in the PATH variable, so we are not sure how we end up using the Ubuntu bash shell from Jenkins.
The other big difference i could see is my node_modules on local machine have around 1535 packages and the one on jenkins workspace has only 1505.
Both depends on OS where the Jenkins agent is running.
For example, in Jenkins we can get $BUILD_NUMBER variable, how can i implement such solution in Openshift?
I 'm running Jenkins on a machine with 4 GPUs and run Jenkins jobs using /code/ to use the GPUs.
I followed the instructions /url/ to increase the logout timer of our Jenkins server.
I 'd really like to get yarn working with TeamCity or Jenkins, however /code/ consumes all my build server 's cpu &amp; memory, even with a tiny npm project.
/code/, when run by TeamCity or Jenkins, consumes most CPU/memory, never finishes .
Since it 's common to Jenkins and TeamCity, it seems like the problem is to do with running sub processes from java.
Tower or Jenkins, you will most likely want to use environment   variables.
Jenkins pipeline automatically creates a global variable for each environment variable .
Jenkins also automatically creates an environment variable for each build parameter (and as a consequence of second point a global variable).
Can I get the check list number from the Jenkins file.
/pre/  The first time I ran this on my Jenkins master, it only included the first four lines (/code/, /code/, /code/, /code/) it succeeded with the following output: .
How can query Jenkins using API to know the last few builds that it executed.
I just want Jenkins to return the last n builds it executed or the builds executed between 2 timestamps .
I am trying to create a powershell mailer script that will receive parameter(mail_ids) as argument from Jenkins.
In my case /code/ does n't work, it causes a /code/ when run in a Jenkins pipeline job.
In order to query build results via API , you have to know the job name in Jenkins.
Now, inside the Jenkins Job configuration of Jenkins, whatever I add in the build step, the steps get executed in the first container .
I have tried to print the Node version inside my Jenkins Job, and the output is "Node not found" .
In one interviewer asked me how to create 100 jobs in jenkins at a time?
Problem I 'm using Jenkins pipeline and testing python with tox.
$result is available only for your shell step, and if you want to use it like jenkins variable ${result} then you can use an Env Inject Plugin.
and then use env inject plugin and point to result.env location, so in the email section you can access $result as a jenkins variable: ${RESULT} .
I mean...environment variables are in the environment from jenkins and not inside the container ?
Do I need to be running jenkins.war instance in background???
Can you pls let me know if there is a way where I can throw the ansible error to shell script and propogate to jenkins groovy code.
/pre/  However, this has the disadvantage that the Environment Variables are shared between every Jenkins job, not just across all branches of a single job.
I reboot the jenkins server imediately after that function call.
So, I have some code in a /code/ and the /code/ function returns a boolean when run in jenkins but returns a list (as expected!)
Your current implementation does n't assign any variables, shell, Jenkins, or otherwise.
At the end of a job Jenkins kills any left over process that was spawned by the job.
I have a bash script that ssh in to different machines in a loop, this script also reboots the machines if there is a reboot=y parameter passed (using jenkins).
I needed to set the JENKINS_NODE_COOKIE env variable to tell Jenkins not to kill my spawn process after the end of the stage :  .
So my second attempt is to use a single Jenkins build with a parameter to specify which branch to build.
I have two separate Jobs in Jenkins, but one job is only allowed to run if another jobs' last state was successful.
However, I 've not yet found a suitable way to get the time a Jenkins node was last brought online.
This default Jenkins image results in a Jenkins container that is preconfigured to point to my Kubernetes cluster.
/pre/  I am writing command in Execute Shell window in Jenkins.
I have a pre-requisite test that needs to be run before the Regression suite in jenkins.
However I have requirement to jenkinize it, and I am wondering if there a way I can define my parameter in the Jenkins Job with different combination or values  say for example:  .
and so on thus I can use the PARAM_KEY in the script and the Jenkins job gets executed for all the parameters defined i.e.
A good idea here could have been to use a global variable defined at the level of Jenkins.
I need this command to have access to push the lerna tags, as well as the updated version numbers to the master branch, and I also need Jenkins to not fall into an infinite loop.
For example to change default parameter value for String parameter, you can run below script in Jenkins console (e.g.
I have a Maven Java Jenkins job which has a Post Step which invokes the 'Execute SonarQube Scanner' with a scan task.
I have a jenkins DSL step that runs my python nosetests and creates a unittest coverage report.
If you really want something for building the QA run for the Jenkins or any CI, I would recommend to run the job as  .
I try to perform the following code in a postbuild Jenkins task: .
Labels may contain any non-space characters, but you should avoid   special characters such as any of these: !&amp;|&lt;>(), as other Jenkins   features allow for defining label expressions, where these characters   may be used.
/pre/  The end step in Jenkins says it succeeds.
I 'm trying to trigger jenkins job through java code.
/pre/  I even tried to follow this /url/ to trigger Jenkins job through command line but i 'm just a beginner i do n't understand.
Can Jenkins send notification mail when somebody changes the Configure(e.g String Parameter, choice Parameter, Execute shell scripts or other stuff) in the job?
And it will need to compare both results and generates a report from a single Jenkins job.
The commands of the Makefile which Jenkins calls in order are as follows: .
I was able to throw up all the errors inside of more than one docker container to jenkins using set -e in a bash script starting my docker containers.
If any container fails with a non zero exit code the script stop the current execution and the exit code is catched by jenkins instead to follow with the next docker container execution.
The solution in my case was rather unexpected - I updated grep to version 2.24, and now, being launched from Jenkins, it takes less than one second to process over 1 MB log file.
Jenkins job that needs to execute bash command and initialise variable locally: .
This one is flagged out as potentially introducing a security vulnerability (since it lets scripts get their hands on the Jenkins instance) .
 I have a parent Jenkins job (/code/) that invokes 2 child-maven-build-jobs (/code/ followed by /code/) in serial (wait for previous to finish before starting next).
Placing the commands on separate lines would not work with regular shell script, regardless of Jenkins.
However if i copy the same set up into Jenkins then below jmeter element in /code/ is not being executed.
When I run  the same code in Jenkins (Windows Service).
Is it possible to run regression tests with Jenkins?
Jenkins passes those parameters as environment variables .

If that slack post is not responded to for a fixed amount of time, I would like Slack to notify Jenkins Pipeline to continue to the next step.
I want to display both results in the Jenkins job overview (above pipeline steps) with a usage of JUnit plugin.
Is it possible that jenkins does n't have access the python2 bindings because it has python3 as its default therefore the yum task cannot execute.
I 'm trying to automate a deployment with Jenkins to an EC2 instance for the first time.
I have seen a lot of response to the question, most of them were actually solution to it but they solve the problem when jenkins is actually run as a standalone CI without Application container using the command: .
I had same task to migrate jenkins from one server to another and the solution I used was /code/ which did the job.
I have a jenkins job to do that which triggers jmx which in turn call Rest APIs.
I will refer this as run 1 Now, after 30 minutes, I will again run the same jenkins job and will again run the jmeter test.
Having the Jenkins job dedicated to special node I 'd like to have a notification if the job ca n't be run because the node is offline.
But I wanted to execute the same code through Jenkins.
I have a jenkins setup with a big amount of jobs.
Just do the same thing, but this time do it for Jenkins user.
Once upon a time, they had Jenkins build our program in minutes.
/pre/  Now in Jenkins you can do a Pipeline and run shell script commands using simple if conditions and pass the value as an argument to your shell script  .
You can pick the context name from jenkins env variable or some other mechanism.
jenkins interact with script input at runtime .
but when i try to do this in jenkins im not able to get the run time option.
Running shell script from jenkins required proper execution permissions.
In Prometheus recording rules, I want to record the rate of job failure in each of my Jenkins job.
Can we do it with some reg expression, so that i do n't have to repeatedly hard code(create new rule) the Jenkins job name(eg: MyJenkinsJob_1, MyJenkinsJob_2, MyJenkinsJob_3, ......).
Every deployment definition within the Jenkins is writes using the shell script.
You can run tests on Jenkins in parallel or in multiple builds.
I 'm hoping to duplicate the functionality of the first run by using properties from maven so that I can run this with Jenkins a bit easier?
The function outside the /code/ block may break the graphical pipeline editor in Jenkins, but if you do n't use that you 're probably fine.
I am using Jenkins Global Library for preforming job execution.
I have two separate repos in Jenkins, foo: containing code, and bar: containing unit tests relevant to foo 's code.
For some background, I 'm using gmaven + junit to unit test some Jenkins pipeline libraries.
In jenkins dsl shell script i just want to create a variable and assign some default value and print it.
I have a Win10 VM having tests run on it, and a Jenkins VM (Windows Server 2008) running those tests on it.
The gist of it, is that at some point in time, the test on Jenkins just 'freezes'.
However, the Jenkins VM had no events at all.
I have a few functions that get called either from Jenkins as part of a pipeline, they also get called from a pester test or lastly they can get called from the powershell console.
If not, you would need to switch to a polling approach, where a cron job in Jenkins would every x minutes monitor your GitHub master branch and trgiger a job on new commits  .
As per my understanding, Once any push event happens in Repo A, it will trigger the one Jenkins job  (ie.
If Jenkins ca n't handle path restrictions on a multibranch pipelines well, then we do it from our pipeline code (or from a shared library to reduce duplication).
I want to pass File as parameter in Jenkins.
/pre/  In my jenkins job, I have a /code/ called /code/ which is different for different jobs.
I need to then retrieve results from these instances (JUnit test results for Jenkins to parse).
I have a groovy script that is creating a variable I need from jenkins.
You can do this with cron job as guys above explaine, but most effective way is to have local Jenkins, or setup Jenkins on any computer (if have any extra) and start jobs in any possible way, with reporting on mail, sms, whatever... .
I"m trying to deploy my lambda function using jenkins, code commit and s3.
This is not possible currently, as they are post-processed they need to be executed in the 1st run before being known to jenkins and being available as 'Build with parameters'.
Another option, is to evaluate if this is the first run or not, and if so, execute the Jenkins job skipping all steps and purely processing the parameters.
Is there a way where i trigger a jmeter job from jenkins for 100 threads and once the test is done the result with below details  .
It 's the first time i 'm trying to use Jenkins, and I cannot understand what are the steps I need to do to make Protractor work and run in Jenkins.
but, because of the space in the path after the word 'Files' its deviding it into 2 and treating the second part - which is just half of the path, as the target path: '(x86)\Jenkins\workspace\jenkins-AutomationFreeStyle-Pipeline-2/'  .
Good Day, I have a groovy script running on a jenkins job like so.
/pre/  For some reason when trying to run this groovy script through Jenkins, or running directly from groovy console It waits on this line.
FYI: I ca n't wait for 15 minutes and keep the current jenkins job at hold and then recycle because I have to do multiple jenkins jobs.
So your JENKINS_HOME environment variable is not correctly set.
I am researching ways to migrate jobs from one Jenkins instance to another.
One thing I have tried is to set up the Jenkins Server and then include the job name in the latter field.
Use jenkins to run unit test and use Jacoco to see code coverage rate.
Here is my current shell script that gets run during my Jenkins process.
As it is your first time doing this, just keep in mind that anything that you qre able to do with command-line, you will be able to do it as well with Jenkins.
Meaning that perhaps some testing tasks ran by Jenkins could be delegated to CodeDeploy or a stage in a CodePipeline which leads to the final CodeDeploy stage.
It looks like Jenkins (2.113) is replacing the string /code/ in some of my shell scripts with /code/.
This makes sense, as I certainly see more people asking about how to write Jenkins variables into output files, but in this case I 'd like it to leave those files alone -- the scripts break if they try to run under the (non-existent) "jenkins" user.
In general, executing protactor tests and any other things are ending up in following, if you are able to execute it in command line than you can execute same command under jenkins using "Execute shell" functional of jenkins.
Otherwise do i need to always depend on cron jobs from jenkins?
I know you can create custom steps by writing plugins for Jenkins and then calling the function in your groovy script, I was just wandering if there is a way to write such a thing directly in groovy, say, in my library.
I 'm not sure how to write a regex for Jenkins that will "consume" that part of the branch name before setting the parameter value.
We have one jenkins job which executes a UFT test first and then executes the selenium test if UFT test is successfull.
Im creating a jenkins job which has choice parameters.
This solution is accurate as of Jenkins ver1.613 .
As I said in comments above that the variable ("Class_To_Run") was not being expanded to its value while the maven command was being executed by jenkins.
The problem was that I had declared the variable in execute shell part in Pre Steps of jenkins job configuration.
With Jenkins using the /code/ how do i get the Dockerfile (/code/ in this example) from the SCM (Git) since the /code/ block is executed before all the stages?
Even though I am not using deleteDir() in my jenkins pipeline script.
I have a powershell script that stops/starts VM in parallel at specific time using Jenkins.
I guess it is a good advice to run below command in Execute Shell section in jenkins: .
How can I have jenkins run a docker container when a job is triggered, somehow start postgresql, and proceed with the rest of the tasks.

I need to clean up some Kubernete namespaces(hello_namespace, second,my_namespace1, my_namespace45,my_namespace44 for example and I do it with a jenkins job.
So the question, are there any ways to solve this, probably using jenkins env variables?
/pre/  This being run in a Jenkins pipeline, not sure if this would make a difference.
To fix this I usually go to Jenkins->Script console and type in the following command: .
I am working with Jenkins and need to take two tasks (currently running in their own job) and have them run in a single job, one after the other.
It looks like the issue may be in the code, and not the way Jenkins itself is executing the Gradle tasks.

I would propose a simple wrapper around your script, eposed by a URL or as already suggested, Jenkins .
2) It is the jenkins and I am trying to analyse jenkins with number of jobs, So How can I identify that this object is unncessarily referenced in memory (OR) What are the ways to free this up?
I have a Jenkins pipeline that runs two jobs on different slaves as follows .
A quick fix is put a sleep(milliseconds) in the job in order to delay the build execution and jenkins will show a progress bar: .
Put pipeline code directly in jenkins instead of fetching it from git, do in first stage what you need do and start git checkout in the second stage .
Actually, the main requirement is to show Jenkins job  build results on Grafana dashboard.

One is a regular freestyle job on Jenkins that is supposed to trigger another job which is a Multibranch pipeline job.
Jenkins resets environment variables to some defaults for their jobs.
Copying my SSH keys to the container might work, but in some cases we have to build the image on remote machines (on Jenkins, or whatever), so I might need a solution that does n't just work locally.
What is the correct way of setting env variables in Jenkins?
Once I do this, my test results appear in a "Test Results" window in Jenkins.
I have a python script that I tested on an EC2 instance, which works perfectly fine on the server but when I try to pass the same parameters from Jenkins job as shown below.
I 'm pretty sure the error is because of the string parameter that I 'm passing through Jenkins parameters but there is n't an option to send both From and To ports as integers in jenkins parameters.
How can I set the parameters to an integer within Jenkins build job?

/pre/  But what I need to do is run two Jenkins jobs which check the status of a particular instance, and then only runs the /code/ or  'stop-instances' command if the status is /code/ or 'running', respectively.
There appears to be a variable substitution precedence that Jenkins enforces in a preprocessing step if you will.
/pre/  Another restriction that this poses is that you truly cannot use dynamic variables in the /code/ portion of the Jenkins declarative pipeline script since Jenkins will first attempt to resolve all variables before execution.
I call these stop  script and start script via jenkins pipeline also.
I have started Jenkins on an aws m5.24xlarge instance with 96 vCPU and 384 GiB memory).
Is there a known maximum number of cores Jenkins can handle or a maximum memory size?
Hi i have a jenkins job called Handler which need these windows commands to get libraries and to execute sucessfully .
Im writing a jenkins pipline called Handler_pipline which run "Handler" job im trying to move those above commands to a pipline so that pipline can be inject then in Handler job.
I know how to do this in python, but since this code is running in jenkins,i need to find a way to the same using Groovy.
I have a jenkins job which does following activity one by one.
Let your CI System (Jenkins, HPE ALM / Octane etc) trigger the execution of the different types of tests.
Make sure the Jenkins job is actually running as /code/: add a step in your job to print /code/.
I 'm running Jenkins with the Performance Plugin.
I have been using Hudson / Jenkins since 2007.
I have a problem when I run the job-dsl scripts; even when a job-dsl job definition was n't updated (and the multibranch pipeline job was n't updated), Jenkins queues all branches for build.
2) My jenkins seems to have 80% of the softreference (observed using HProf) .
If Jenkins consumes excessive old generation memory, it may help to   make soft references easier to flush by reducing   /code/ from its default (1000) to something smaller (say 10-200).
Interestingly on another instance this same dsl is working, though this has a never version of Jenkins.
I will assume that you are using a single instance of Jenkins, not a Master-Slave structure (Jenkins with multiple nodes): .
When you create Pipeline type Job in Jenkins it gives you two options in "Pipeline Definition".
I currently have a Jenkins pipeline job that runs a groovy Jenkinsfile to run a go script and returns either an empty string or an error string in which case an email is sent.
(the external process is to run jenkins job that uses data that created in steps 1 + 2 in my system.If the jenkins not finished, all the next steps 3 - 100 will fail) the complexity is that I want all of the threads will start running together, thread groups (= tests) 2 + 3 will be in hold after step 2, and wait that the external process of thread group 1 is finished and than continue the run.
Instead, we have Jenkins balancing the test jobs using a slave node or another.
In windows I wrote CS progarm that kill possible process and/or run 'UnLock IT' it with Jenkins job that also free up resources.
Jenkins performance plugin states .
We have a Jenkins server which has successfully built our code over 200 times - until a couple of days ago.
Why not put a when clause on your pause task to check for the existence of some other variable and then pass that in using Ansible 's -e option when running the playbook through Jenkins.
I would suggest you to use a jenkins node and trigger your java code on node.
Note: Jenkins job allows anonymous triggers and I could run it locally.
I would like to know how Jenkins manage the queued jobs, I mean does it uses a Message Queue system like rabbitmq or the jobs are treated like threads inside the application?
/pre/  When you added it inside /code/ block Jenkins was looking for a method instead of import class statement.
The answer to your question is parallel execution There are multiple ways to achieve this like 1> Creating a Jenkins Job, Registering all the server machines as slave and executing jobon servers Or 2> A comparitively simpler and more widely used concept, using Selenium Grid To Implement Selenium Grid ( for instance with java as a programming language and TestNG framework) we need to take care that  A. we have implemented Threading for our webdriver, so that each execution works on its own driver instance.
This way i have managed 3 Jenkins files in a single repository.
I do this for many projects by using a Jenkins server - I happen to run it on another ec2 instance, but you could also run it on-premise if you prefer.
So What should we have to use either Java 10 or Java 8 for Jenkins ?
docker run -d -u jenkins --name appdev-jenkins --network=host --memory="8g" -p 80:8080 -p 443:443 -p 50000:50000 -v "/opt/jenkins":/var/jenkins_home -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  jenkinsci/blueocean .
The best way is to make your playbook write the output into a file that Jenkins can then parse.
In fact Jenkins uses Groovy as a scripting language for almost this exact thing!
/pre/  SO out of 15 runs in jenkins, the above step fails at-least 10-11 times.
Depending upon your given statement and some assumptions, You can try to re-write the Jenkins pipeline to add one more tag:latest.
When I first installed Allure on our Jenkins pipeline, it was a short increase to the total build time and created excellent reports.
I have a python script that I tested on an EC2 instance, which works perfectly fine on the server but when I try to pass the same parameters from Jenkins job as shown below.
I 'm pretty sure the error is because of the string parameter that I 'm passing through Jenkins parameters but there is n't an option to send both From and To ports as integers in jenkins parameters.
How can I set the parameters to an integer within Jenkins build job?
The Python scripts executes up to that point so I 'm know the script is getting called from the Jenkins job.
And only spawn new Jenkins slaves on this node pool (using taint &amp; tolerations).
Result: Now I can use multi-stage build for Jenkins slaves running on GKE.
We have one Jenkins job per microservice.
you can write a shell script in build option to call the another jenkins job on other server.
I have a java program in a windows system and I need Jenkins job from my company Linux server to trigger the java program in windows machine.
Note that the method runs with no problems; it is run as part of a Jenkins shared library.
So that class is not resolvable by the compiler, but it is when run inside Jenkins.
For example, if you define LOCAL_ENVR as Jenkins parameter, you can manipulate the variable from stages: .
/pre/  This will output your hash, with prefix 2a, the correct prefix for Jenkins hashes.
But I ca n't do that since I need the trend in Jenkins.
Split the test parameters into smaller batches and run the test suite for each batch, then aggregate the results - this could be done in the Jenkins job.
Need help in figuring out a way in which we can get sum of execution time for previous jobs to be provided as input for next job in jenkins pipeline.
In my case, it usually happens on doing Jenkins.
application running on port 8080 and since jenkins was up on that port... Again my bad.
I have multiple jenkins pipelines setup to cater all these jobs, and handling the conditions on stage level to skip them using For e.g.
Running Jenkins 2.89, SVN 1.92, SUSE 12-SP2 Running Master only .
I have tested this from the "Shell Script" in a Jenkins job (I did not want to store a new Python script into SCM, that 's why searched for a one-line solution) and it worked for Linux and Windows.
/url/ I have a Jenkins job that runs A first and then B.

I would like to be able to pass in the build status of the first Jenkins job to the second job.
/pre/  I have confirmed that it works in a Jenkins pipeline (unlike the spread operator, /code/).
So I could expire multibranch jobs that havent run in a month and jenkins would delete those jobs and ignore those branches (even if a jenkinsfile was in them).
So basically I 'm looking for inter-process communication between python script which is run as batch file and Jenkins.
I have a Jenkins Pipeline job (Windows) where I run the following 'bat' command inside a steps block: .
Now I create a jenkins job with string parameter, and this parameter is come from the upstream job.
I also want to call the test suites from a CI like jenkins and automate it to run after every 1 hour.
I want to create a Jenkins (v2.126) Declarative syntax pipeline, which has stages with when() clauses checking the value of an environment variable.
Specifically I want to set a Jenkins job parameter (so 'build with parameters', not pipeline parameters) and have this determine if a stage is executed.
We have so much cases where the length is big that it 's really a big job to refactor everything, so I 'm looking on how to specify to jenkins a smaller path?
Here is an example with a public jenkins instance and one of its builds in order to get "candidate_revision" parameter for "lastSuccessfulBuild" build: .
/pre/  The only problem is every time I ran it, Jenkins shell print the result of /code/ rather than as a comparison value.
With the small example I could not reproduce the zombie processes, but here is the situation from a more complex Jenkins job: .
When the closure ends and Jenkins tries to stop the container, the following processes are left: .
As workaround I added the init process as subreaper also to problematic  'docker exec' calls and problematic  'sh' calls in the Jenkins docker().inside() closure.
Chrome versions on the Jenkins slaves are in line with my local version (67.0.3396.99) and Chrome driver is also inline (2.40.565498).

Obviously, we need to run the tests automatically in Jenkins.
I have a jenkins pipeline with a /code/ call at the end.
/pre/  PS: You may want to run your container always as jenkins user, in that case you can use /code/ after you finished installations and do any additional unprivileged operations there.
Im trying to set a environment variable(VIRTUALENV) in Jenkins - stage(check_style) and use that in the shell but it throws a error.
I have many jenkins pipelines for several different platforms but my "post{}" block for all those pipelines is pretty samey.
Goal:  What I want to achieve is that for the Jenkins job > build > Environment Variables page, I will be able to see in the table the variable JAVA_HOME .

How do I get WorkflowMultiBrancProject object from jenkins job name (string) using java.
We ca n't do an local merge with the develop branch every time as sometimes PR 's have a different base branch, or Jenkins needs to get the base branch of that PR and do a local merge.
The easiest solution is to change the Jenkins Service to run with the WIndows Account you set the variable for.

I have two jenkins jobs , I want to trigger the second job after the successful completion of the first job say after 12 hours of time.I need to execute 2 Jenkins jobs after certain time one after the other based on successful completion of first job  .
of course, you probably do n't need to clone every time, but this is basically how Jenkins works.
I have a Jenkins batch command step, which makes query to MSSQL DB and return a result: .
I Am facing issues while running the Robot framework scripts in Jenkins,and executing scripts using "Execute Windows batch command" and my scripts in my local D:Drive.

How can I set up those variables for a Jenkins build slave?
It seems like when running everything in Docker containers in Jenkins, you 'll have to start /code/ in detached mode /code/ first, wait, and then start /code/.
I do n't think jenkins can be totally replaced by a webpack instance, for eg: there is no way to consume code from your github automagically the same way that jenkins does.
Now if i try to run the test in Jenkins, the systemproperty variable does NOT return the expected value.It is empty.
I 'm trying to do a cURL command in my gitlab-ci file on a Jenkins' API endpoint to start a job, but no matter what I try the second parameter always gets dropped.
When running this inside the "Powershell" input box of a Jenkins job .

Note that this may mean calling /code/ from within your Jenkins job - this is pretty typical; you would do something similar whether you were using Python virtualenv, Ruby bundler, etc.
And in Jenkins job I was able to run tests (example below) .
I created a Jenkins job where it run some JMeter scripts and return .jtl files.
However, when I let Jenkins run the unit tests, using the same commands, then call /code/ in my Jenkinsfile, I end up with all code included in the report attached to the build, so my coverage ends up being 2% because I did n't write tests for a bunch of 3rd party libraries.
So far I 've tried adding groups tags to each test class and changed the Jenkins job from a pipeline job to whatever the opposite is ... but only 75 tests continue to run.
/pre/  I 'm trying to run this from Jenkins which is why I ca n't simply run the command on the EC2 like this: .
07:47:25 [chx-sync_-sync_master-A2F53LY4I2X54TLDEU2Z2PXI423NI6FODHQDS7CRIKCCNDF5UGOA] Running shell script   07:47:25 + ./package.sh   07:47:25 /home/jenkins/jenkins/workspace/chx-sync_-sync_master-A2F53LY4I2X54TLDEU2Z2PXI423NI6FODHQDS7CRIKCCNDF5UGOA@tmp/durable-dbcb4143/script.sh: line 1: ./package.sh: not found .
So you should be able to easily run tests without the IDE, from the command prompt (which is eventually how your tests would be run in a Continuous Integration environment such as Jenkins) .
The PR starts two builds - one for travis, and one for jenkins.

I want to add this /code/ value to my test definition in my BUILD file, so that the night build (jenkins) runs this test multiple times.
this code is called by jenkins like this.
I know that with jenkins you can choose branch with git parameter plug in, but for this case that would be TO CHOOSE ANSILBE CODE, which is the one that does the job  instead of the JAva application code (which is in the jenkinsfile) .
/pre/  This will instruct Jenkins pipeline unit environment that the method /code/ that accepts a single argument of type /code/ is allowed to use in the pipeline and invocation of this method will be registered in the unit test result stack.
Therefore a nice move is to set it in a password variable in Jenkins and to pass this variable in the /code/ property value.
Is there any way to run Katalon tests remotely from Jenkins?

I 'm analying a bit of code in one of the Jenkins builds which uses recursion to get jenkins' downstream jobs' urls .
/pre/  This works OK for a project which has downstream jobs although it 's making too many calls to Jenkins rest api, but if a project does n't have downstream jobs it is stuck in recursion.
I am writing a Jenkins job to show CPU utilization on a particular time and my Jenkins job is capable of handling AWS command using AWS cli.

The following code removes the recursion by using a stack instead, and is guaranteed to call the Jenkins API for each job URL just once: .
/pre/  Last but not least, I strongly suspect that using a third-party library like the /url/ would make this all even simpler; the Jenkins API probably lets you query this information in just one call but a library probably does such a call for you and give you readily-parsed Python objects for the information.
All I can say is that this seems to work as of today in Jenkins 2.73. .
So the issue that we 're facing is that even though PERSON is set to Mr Jenkins, and CC is only set to PERSON (thus Mr Jenkins) in the 'hello' block, so we expected the 'when test' block to run because it would reference the ("global") environment variable CC clang, and enter the stage, and then print "hello clang, this step ran".
Which is confusing because in order to enter the stage, CC must be clang, but instead Mr Jenkins was printed in the echo statement.

The maximum number of concurrent builds that Jenkins may perform on this agent.
This does not apply to the Jenkins master — setting the number of executors to zero will prevent any builds from being executed on the master.
I 'd like to use a /code/ block in a shared-variable ("vars/") script rather than directly in the Jenkins pipeline because this is a lower-level semantic of a particular library, and also may or may not be required depending on the situation.
Jenkins "boolean" parameters are really just a shortcut for the "choice parameter" type with the choices hardcoded to the strings "true" and "false", and with a checkbox to set the string variable.
Has anyone managed to get a multi-line string input parameter working with the Jenkins pipeline?
Multi-line string parameters are in the out-of-the-box Jenkins package, but does n't seem to be there in the pipeline.

I have multiple jobs for one Pull requests running on Jenkins.
I have a job in Jenkins and I need to trigger another one when it ends (if it ends right).
I had the heap memory cleared it through "Monitoring" plugin and also upgraded to 2.x (say 2.65 or 2.89.4) version of Jenkins and it solved my issue .
Personally I would steer away from Jenkins-specific tools but rely on something more generic like environment variables, that will keep on working if you 'd ever switch CI 's plus is easy to test locally on the command line without any CI at all.
Surely Jenkins, like other CI, sets an environment variable containing a build number.
Cannot conditional build NIGHTLY (and by timer) when there was not difference between previous NIGHTLY and the current one (I 'm able to do that in the shell script to retrieve last/true NIGHTLY repo manifest, but that 's already when the Jenkins triggered the build...so have already a void record, as I 'm exiting at this stage my script).
But still I feel - why I need Jenkins at all if the whole logic I need resides in external scripts.
However Jenkins can also kick-start the execution of your Test Suite through the /code/ and Maven.
I have created a bash function to copy certain test results from jenkins slave to Jenkins master 's /code/ directory.

If you do n't want bifurcate behavior based on branch, I would suggest you have 2 different jobs (pipelines) defined in Jenkins: one to run every commit from the developers during the day and one that is scheduled to run nightly that executes your long running tests.
I have a Jenkins Pipeline script which takes parameters and then calls another jenkins job for each of those parameter.
My understanding of Jenkins is quite limited, so it might be pretty much possible that I am doing something that should be done in a much better way.
When I want to start the script with Jenkins (running on Ubuntu), and the result is malformed but successfully (test-result).
From the Jenkins help: /code/ where /code/ is the day of the month (1-31) and /code/ is the day of the week (0–7) where 0 and 7 are Sunday.
You can write /code/, and while editing the job 's configuration Jenkins will suggest making that /code/, where H means a hash value of the job 's name (so that if you have multiple jobs that are scheduled to run more or less together they will spread across the hour).
Does n't anyone know of a Jenkins plugin that ensures that when a job is re-run, it runs on a different node to the previous one?
/pre/  I do n't understand why does Jenkins not run the steps inside the docker container.

I have one job in jenkins which is executing testng suite.
It will run on that node, which Jenkins thinks, is the best right now.
I am not sure that my case is exactly the same as your but the TL;DR is that you need make sure that Docker is available to the PATH variable Jenkins is using.
instance role based IAM policies leak to the instance (which is n't idea for a jenkins server for example).
Unfortunately, turning off the /code/ flag is not an option, as the command runs with that flag during a Jenkins job.

I have a Jenkins job that I need to run /code/ for.
Currently, we have a Windows Server VM on GCE and Jenkins runs jobs on it from time to time.
For 1 test case it 's pasting correct path of file upload but for other test case its only pasting character 'v'  and also have anybody have idea why robot class does not work in case of if we run test cases on remote machine on jenkins.
As a workaround, you can set the depth to 2 if you run a Jenkins build for every commit as explained in /url/.
But a separate Jenkins pipeline job fails when I attempt to esentially do the same thing using:  .
But now we would like to run this tests by Jenkins and select one or more tests by parameters instead of comment out /code/.
What are good practices to run different test combinations within different jenkins jobs?
Adding nodejs (later) automatically at Jenkins build time is not a   good thing, because it slows the build process down.
/pre/  Also you could use some jenkins variable like currentBuild.result instead of flag like this : .
Adding nodejs (later) automatically at Jenkins build time is not a good thing, because it slows the build process down.
/pre/  and let Jenkins run it with a parameter as needed: .
You want to pass this variable to another program (I 'm guessing that 's what you mean when you say 'execute that in Jenkins') but the value of the variable has an extra set of quotes, specifically outer single quotes, which you do not want.
If you wanted to get fancier, you could call Jenkins and let it take over the pre-release tasks.
/pre/  This will pass through without attempting to evaluate the ${var} as a Jenkins/Groovy variable.
I can easily move all unit tests from different pods to my main app and create a unit test target for the same (which solves the Jenkins job issue too) but then my main app will get cluttered with a lot of unit test code it does not require at all.
Yes, via String parameter supplied to your jenkins job.
I also have some files on zone with text that I grep during the execution of this jenkins job.
In that case Jenkins runs: .
tls_config:        insecure_skip_verify: true       static_configs:         - targets: ['jenkins.example.com:8080'] .
For both cases we use Jenkins + EC2 plugin to spin up large instances(workers) and run pipelines on them.
1) How can I build a Jenkins job which will run automatically at a particular time everyday?
For first simply example there will be 5, 6 nodes and i know that Jenkins will work perfectly with them.
Are there another solution like Jenkins but for much much devices and nodes?
For those wanting to parse CTest output in a Jenkins Declarative Pipeline, you can now do this quite easily using the /url/, since it can parse CTest output directly.
Due to large amount of dependencies between Maven projects, we rely mostly on /code/ to ensure that Jenkins jobs are triggered in the right order.
Jenkins is running on windows server 2016.
I started noticing a problem with the Jenkins java executable taking up to 60% of my CPU time every time a job would trigger.
It was probably overkill, but I went wild and upped the Java Heap Space for Jenkins from the default 256mb to 4gb; which solved this problem for me.See this solution for instructions:  /url/ .
Put your regular stages in the first one, and all the tests in the other (you can divide the work here into multiple stages as well for clarity), be sure to have the other one use the appropriate triggers like for jenkins-pipeline: .
The parameter defined in configuration of a Jenkins job should be a "String Parameter" in order to set them using URL.
Normally you should run your JMeter test on Jenkins directly, either on /url/ node or on one of /url/.
It runs locally with /code/, it works from the terminal in the Jenkins executor using the same command, but it does n't from the normal pipeline.
How can I detect that my environment is Jenkins so that I can make the assumption condition more strict?
As part of my Jenkinsfile, i am trying to load the secret file i have on my Jenkins machine and use it as a variable to pass into my terraform script.
But I see  $JENKINS_HOME/workspace/_job_name_PR-251-4MSWSIVZHFONFLOHNITFTR6R5CAJMNKESIVZHFONFLOHNITFTR6@script I tried below but did not cleanup   .
/pre/  If I have Jenkins file with below lines, how can I start the Xvfb first then start running the tests suite?
We have a project where we have several Jenkins jobs:  One type of jobs that runs delivery (A),  .
/pre/  So ensure Jenkins can do the following things from command line: .
It should run at same time with other (cmd) processes // Jenkins .
I am triggering builds with parameters in Jenkins using Python request to the /url/ and I do n't get any queue or build numbers to identify my build.
/pre/  The same one is on remote Compute Engine machine which running Jenkins.
Under the Jenkins shell execute it 's always throws  .
You can make you application accept arguments and then pass a TRUE/FALSE value indicating it is running from Jenkins or not.
I need 2 Jenkins jobs to be able to run my gradle script and deploy to 2 server groups in parallel or concurrently.
In my case, I have one server for Jenkins.
If you can believe this --windows store was running on port 8080 and blocking my Jenkins port.
Note: this was a rather drastic approach to clearing port 8080 - a better option would be to just move Jenkins to another port but I was feeling a bit draconic.
/pre/  But when I run the same test inside Jenkins build step .
The purpose of the job is to take in a generic shell script and run the script on the Jenkins node.
This is so that an 3rd party application could send the script to Jenkins as a "parameter" to the job so it could run different scripts based on different situations.
I have a few Jenkins build jobs for compiling a .NET application using /code/, /code/, and unit test case execution steps.
When I use DBUtils.java in Eclipse and run the tests there it works fine, but when I run it through Jenkins the first time that DBUtils are used is failing.
I am trying to launch Protractor-cucumber script from Jenkins but while running tests browser size it not getting maximized.
We want to verify that the Jenkins node is healthy before starting time-consuming integration tests.
If you are using webpack, you can use /url/ to get an environment variable at compile time from Jenkins, and then define it as a global constant for your React components to use.
I would expect a Jenkins running on Linux to be much better at handle big number of builds  .
I am trying to create multiple threads in a jenkins pipeline script.
On Jenkins master/server there is a Environment Variable: /code/ which point to a directory used to hold all material of job/template etc.
I 've noticed that whenever I attempt to build my .NET solution scripted within the jenkins file, on different nodes in parallel, one of the builds is successful but the others fail.
Review the active threads on Jenkins using the monitoring plugin and identify the threads with unusually high cpu time.
Determine if the thread is spun by a plugin or the jenkins application itself(Dump the thread stack or hover over the thread to see the stack).
I have a simple JenkinsFile that I 'm running through Jenkins v2.121.3 on Ubuntu v18.04.1 LTS: .
I have a requirement where I need 2 Jenkins job, One job to take user parameters (eg: user chooses number 10 which means I need to run second job 10 times) second job will be the actual execution of test automation.
The suggestion in AXIS-2909 is to take latest 1.4.1-SNAPSHOT, from a successful jenkins build in 2017.
Is there a way that I can allocate more memory to the Jenkins via some server settings?
I know that while Jenkins is running the job, it sents a system environment variable /url/.
I 'm running one test over 2 browsers selected from the Jenkins job.
I have Jenkins(2.89.4) instance which has jdk 1.8.
I am trying to write the corresponding dsl code for a jenkins job and i am stuck at Build step and do n't know how to code Send Files or Execute commands over SSH.
Is there a way to trigger a Jenkins job using curl and passing custom Workspace and string parameter.
I see the below Jenkins pipeline: `try{     saltCmd = "\"salt -E \"($target)\" \                    state.apply projects.alip.process-server \                         pillar=\'{\"region\": \"${Region}\",\"siteid\":\"${SiteID}\",\"dbuser\":\"${DBUSER}\",\"dbpass\":\"${DBPASS}\"}\' \"" .
/pre/  I have no idea how or why it is using a string pointer because I thought that /code/ concated arrays and ArrayList... Plus it is in Jenkins so it is a pain to test.
Our Jenkins instance submits jobs to a batch system (slurm) for execution of individual tasks.
A single jenkins job might submit a few thousand batch jobs and we need a unique way to correlate all these batch jobs to the original jenkins job.
the Jenkins ID) is n't ideal because there may be overlap in IDs among jobs from different pipelines, and also unnecessarily couples our batch and CI system; a UUID seems to be a more generic option.
Is there a way in Jenkins, preferably from a groovy script, to store an arbitrary key/value with a job along with some way to query jenkins for that key/value to get back to the job?
I do n't know how to call and populate the vars map and the body closure from the Jenkins 2 pipeline.
I have following jenkins pipeline step which wait for user input to certain steps in release.
I am setting up test result reporting in Jenkins for test projects written in various test frameworks (NUnit, MSTest, etc) and would like to improve my understanding with regards to report types and the difference between stages and post in the pipeline execution.
am trying to do a jenkins job that uploads a file into a python container and then reload the container.
/pre/  For example, how can I determine the average time John Smith Sent with Sally Jenkins, output that, and then separately determine the average time John Smith spent with Adam apple?
I need to get /code/ variables in my Jenkins pipeline.
A Multi line batch in the Jenkins file could be a solution if the process remains the same over all the multiple lines.
Turns out I have cancelled a Jenkins job previously in the step where the tests were running, so /code/ did not quit (had a handful of running /code/ processes, paired with /code/ ones, blocking the further test execution).
I 'm able to automate the lumping process through a script, so I 'm wondering if I can automate Jenkins to output frameworks for both architecture types and call then call this custom script.
That way your step can read /code/ and the definition will read /code/ or whatnot that you set within the Jenkins environment.
What the Jenkins tries to achieve is to run a test on a.jar file on a Jenkins node with CentOS but the test needs to be run on a Debian OS, in order to do that on the CentOS node, the Jenkinsfile has a stage with a Docker agent and a commmand that  pulls the openjdk image from Dockerhub and run some command in it.
My first question is that the Jenkins documentation syntax is different from the one used here but in the lesson video it runs with no issues, the correct syntax should be /code/ My second question is, wheter I use one or the other syntax, and also I used the openjdk:7u181-jre because the one from the lesson is not longer available, I get this error in the console log output: /url/ .
I 'm not super-happy about this though, because now the release is only guaranteed to work in the one Jenkins job and is n't readily portable.
I need to know if is it possible to show, in a jenkins parmetrized build pipeline,  a parameter value inside a message of an input step.
I 'm running on maven 1.9.9 - cucumber 1.9.5 - serenity 1.9.9 - chromedriver 2.40 - jenkins 2.19.1 .
I am trying to schedule a jenkins job (timer) to start my Azure VMs back up on the third sunday of every month at 6AM.
as Jenkins launches the job as non-interactive manner, you need to pass /code/ with the variables and their value when calling the playbook (ex: /code/).
I am trying to pass the variable value from one stage to the mail body of jenkins.
Therefore, Jenkins places all shell code into a shell script file, in the temp directory, something like /tmp/sh/jenkins45723947385985.sh and then executes it as follows: .
I have a Jenkins Pipeline JOB where I declared some stages that use an external function that I created by myself in the same groovy script.
First off in my implementation of things Jenkins is actually a container in Docker.
There 's a bunch of other steps that I do but basically they are the same steps that a user is going to go through (except it 's all in my Docker file) and I add the results of "docker-machine env" to the global variables in the Jenkins configuration.
1) is your data even good for box -Jenkins model( ARIMA)?
Though rohit answer shows one way of setting variables on Jenkinsfile, I 'd rather rely on things that Jenkins itself does, so I checked the environment variables set on my Jenkins jobs, and there 's many options to pick from: .
These seem to be constant on a Jenkins instance.
While it does n't imply the build is being run by Jenkins, it will always be set in that case.

I am using a multibranch pipeline in jenkins and would like to record time taken by each pipeline stage and store it in DB.
I have a Jenkins job on there which should run Protractor tests using Chrome headless, I have tried a number of configurations including using Xvfb and not using Xvfb and I always get the same result where the tests start to run and do the first browser.get command but after a few seconds the tests error with: .
/pre/  problem is that I 'm not familiar with groovy and jenkins pipeline so I do n't know  what type should variables jobs and parameters of method multiJob be and how to properly call multiJob from pipeline step .
I use the followig command from udeploy Shell step to invoke a Jenkins job.
Irrespective of whether i invoke the jenkins job directly from a shell on the server or from a Shell step in Udeploy, the problem is the same.
This might become a problem if/when additional submodules are tracked, esepcially when I 'm trying to have the stage/commit/tag operation as a Jenkins global library function.
What 's the difference between these thre way to stop a Jenkins pipeline?
You can imagine, if I queue up 5-10 different projects around the same time, then Jenkins will slow down (running simultaneous builds from different projects), and polling for each of those projects will continue to add another build for the same commit which is already queued or building.
I perform two activities (one is  to manually trigger jmeter-server on m1 and other to run jenkins job to run test via m1) .
I have a Jenkins job which I have parameterized with a parameter /code/, and set some default value for the parameter.
To get around this we configured Jenkins to target the 32-bit cygwin instance and for 32-bit jobs we can use the Shell Script build step.
Unfortunately, for jobs that need to use the 64-bit instance we use a Batch Script in Jenkins and invoke the 64-bit instance of cygwin shell and run a shell script (.sh) that we maintain in source control.
We 'd really like to be able to set the shell executable per job instead of per jenkins instance so that we can put some of the more simple shell commands in a shell script build step.
All you need to do is to declare the same set of parameters in JOB B as in JOB A. Jenkins will take care of passing the parameters to the downstream job.
I 've had Jenkins builds going for up to 24 hours without an issue, there is n't any strict limit on the length of a build.
Actually there are couple of unresolved bugs with groovy closures in Jenkins pipelines, for example /url/ and /url/.
I need to run jenkins pipeline every 5 minutes and trigger stages only if /tmp/*.json exists.
I have to schedule a Jenkins job  which runs every Day of the week, every Month in a year , every Day in a month but after a specific date.
Your shell script does n't need to be in a VM at all, it just needs to be accessible by the Jenkins server.
/pre/  The variable since is not evaluating in the Jenkins output.
So, what I am trying to achieve is have some data I am pulling from an api and dump it to a database, then query from the database to create a JSON file every 5 minutes(using jenkins and python, the best approach I can think of).
subprocess.call(['curl', '-X', 'POST', '-H',   'Jenkins-Crumb:cdf99f1d3924f50d7db20bdb7ca47ff6',   'jenkinsPath="https://user_jenkins:d547e0393635027f0f26859211b200cb@jenkins.host/job/Testing/job/script-Testing/view/change-requests/job/PR-115/build']) .

Since I do n't know at which state Jenkins job exists at the time I am running my script, I want to run the job both ways and my desire for the wrong URL to catch the error so it does n't produce any noise and break my script.
/pre/  Above is my command line block, which I put in Jenkins job.
When I run it in Jenkins, the Global Properties parameter cannot be passed in the request.
/pre/  And the result after a run with Jenkins .
I have a jenkins pipeline file where i need to call an sh file .
You can run powershell as a process in a script and call that from Jenkins.
One important thing when runing MUnits in Jenkins is the following.
I do n't plan to change this, since JENKINS-26100 allows the checkout step (and the git step) to return a map of names and values from the checkout.
The simplest way is to put the Jenkinsfile at the root of your repository and get the value of the WORKSPACE environment variable set by Jenkins.
One thing to note, if you are using a freestyle job, you wo n't be able to access build parameters or the Jenkins JVM 's environment UNLESS you are using System Groovy Script build steps.
First of all common practice is to deploy Jenkins to a server which is always up or at least at the time of scheduled time.
To check Jenkins service status on windows using the command line run following command .
The Jenkins UI waits 5 seconds before   making the next call.
I have process (jenkins) that starts UI test so I need to run them in GUI context.
This needs to run in an automatic way within a jenkins script.
The Jenkins (service Windows / daemon Linux) need to run.
I have a Jenkins file that have many steps.
1) I want to run ansible playbook and keep a var in Jenkins run (like environment variable or something) .
Been searching all day for why Jenkins does not execute a Windows batch command     java x.y.java$Test .
CLASSPATH is the same when I view Jenkins Environment variables or the systems variables.
Running Jenkins 2.138.1 .
However, when Jenkins does this (same user account but executes command as an argument to the SSH command) it fails to find an application on the path.
Return to jenkins that the script was successful (meaning that it will end the job as SUCCESS) .
It means that Jenkins pipeline Groovy script gets executed in the Groovy shell that uses CPS transformation - it modifies the code so it supports this continuous passing style.
For achieving this i am running the given windows batch command inside Jenkins.

This will host a seperate command prompt that runs async from the powershell script and restarts the computer in 3 seconds, enough time for powershell to return the exit code to jenkins.
Jenkins command should navigate to  ‘/my/desired/location/’ on machine ‘m1’ and trigger ‘ls’ command .
on Jenkins pipelines you can declare environment variables at the top of the script like this: .
Jenkins 2.x has the global variables.
Jenkins 2.107.2 still use Java 8 .
Why does the Jenkins git pipeline plugin now have a problem checking out a branch using a variable?
/pre/  I 'd need to do the equivalent thing with a Groovy script (as part of a Jenkins job)  but I could n't find any example of it, except for file system listing.
/pre/  However, there 's no guarantee that control will return to Jenkins in time and that Jenkins itself will have time to process the successful exit before it is shut down itself.
When I test code analysis with MSBuild on Jenkins server (by command line) I have 87 warnings.
Therefore I downloadede the /code/for my Jenkins instance.
So, I had attached the jenkins-volume mount option in the container - task definition.
In a Jenkins-X cluster the default behaviour is that when you make a change to the code of one of your microservices then it 's chart version is automatically bumped whether or not the chart itself changes.
Im running out of ideas on how to run shell commands in Groovy in Jenkins and record the output.
All Jenkins steps that use the /code/ context will execute on those agents (from the /code/ blocks).
But, the actual Groovy /code/ method and JVM code execute on the Jenkins master.
I am already doing something like this, in the jenkins file of the library actually: .
All is well, but we want the Jenkins script to run with a higher previlige and hence need to know:  .
The JAR file is working if i run in a normal windows batch command window but the same command is not working if i executed it from a Jenkins windows batch command build section.

How can we pass (parameter)  three node slave variable by using same pipeline as a code in Jenkins.
I have a Jenkins pipeline job (not multi-branch pipeline), one of the logic inside my pipeline is, when there is a merge request on the gitlab scm, I want to build something based on the source branch of the merge request which triggered this build.
Is it possible in Jenkins to create a job, that will run n-times?
/pre/  I can run the /code/ on my shell fine and it works, but Jenkins does n't like it for some reason.
I 'm running a bunch of test cases every hour using selenium-java 3.12.0; TestNG; Selenoid with docker, Jenkins.
Since jenkins does many parallel tasks, it is highly probable that the UT runs on your local but not on CI.
Even wrote a jenkins plugin that provides an /code/ global variable.
Suppose that I have one jenkins node with one executor and I have to run i.e.
I think you ca n't run Jenkins job according to your above code.
/pre/  Jenkins has identified only 3 out of 4 branches even though all 4 branches have the JenkinsFile.
/pre/  The /code/ step causes Jenkins to cancel after 10 minutes.
With Jenkins Pipelines, you can use /code/ and /code/ steps to copy over data from one node to the other, which should exactly fit your use case.
How does it map the variable /code/ to the corresponding Jenkins Job.
In this case Jenkins will use /code/ variable it finds during the execution and it 's just the one you configured in your environment variables.
This is easier (since this is same as your Jenkins approach).
I currently run a Jenkins instance inside a Docker container.
In Jenkins, I have used the /url/ to timeout and abort the build if the build takes more than a certain specified time.
On Jenkins console, I can see whether the process is running or not using invoke command.
It should be noted that when it comes to Windows Batch Steps Jenkins will not Run As Administrator (at least it has n't in the years since 2007 I have been using Jenkins).
So you are running Jenkins on port 80 inside your container wherever in scenario 2 you are running Jenkins on port 8080 inside the container and exposing it over the same port on host machine.
Same is the scenario in your case of Jenkins too.
I am having problems figuring out how to pass some variables into the parallel runs in the Jenkins groovy script below: .
When I do a build for the first time in the life time of Jenkins project, I need to have the pod file path as "./Podfile" as in 1 of the commented code.
$RAKE_TASK may have spaces in it depending on the parameters given to the rake task, which bash/jenkins do n't deal with cleanly So, we interpolate the variables into a double-quoted string, then eval the result.
Say you need to run the following programs as user /code/ as part of your Jenkins job: .
Jenkins needs to know certain things about your build environment and jobs in order to do its job properly.
The first two stages are kind of standard to build a NodeJS app, the third one, however, is the part that I want to Jenkins copy new files to the server.
With an IAM jenkins user, one could limit who is able to run the aws cli commands by locking down credential files on the instance.
I 'm starting to use async/await at some points and seems that the default version of node that has Jenkins does n't handle async/await.
I ended up just returning string value and print to the console where a shell script in my jenkins job would get the output: .
In my real use-case, the value specifies a port to bind, and I need to run multiple instances of the program in my Jenkins server, so each one should have a different value even though they use the same config file.
I have recently tried to API load testing, and I choose maven+OKHTTP+allure reports+jenkins,    when I just try one time run everything is fine, the reports get generated successfully but after that I make the test run for 100 times,    then I just look at the reports - it 's only showing the first time runs.
I have a PowerShell script to be executed as a build step in jenkins and need to pass environment variable to it .
What @Daniel Majano says is true about the /code/ syntax, but the /code/ syntax I found holds differences of behavior between a /code/ maintained directly in Jenkins vs /code/.
Perhaps there is a way to call faker that will pass a specific random number so we can use jenkins to run a build that passes a unique the random number?
With that you can create 2 listeners --> Example 1 https (with ACM ssl certificate) that proxy/offload traffic to Jenkins port HTTP:8080 and other tcp:50000 that forward/bridge traffic to backend servers port 50000.  .
Is there any way to get a list of everything in Jenkins that is scheduled to be "Started by timer" .
/pre/  But I need to run this script from a Jenkins pipeline where I have only one chance.
I had a similar problem running Jenkins 2.121.2 on Windows.
/pre/  However, now that we know that you 're invoking the command line via /code/ (a batch file) from Jenkins (a build step of type /code/), the simpler answer is indeed to let /code/ expand the environment-variable reference, using its /code/ syntax: .
In my case it turned out that it is better to use a throw-away containers with proper volumes instead of using a installed node/npm in the container with Jenkins.
How do I make all the execution to run locally and use Jenkins just to trigger the jobs?
Can anyone let me know is there any way that I can use a single Jenkins job for different feature branches (i.e.. the job should be triggered whenever a code is pushed to any of the feature branch and build should be triggered for that particular branch not any other branch) .
/pre/  In case any one did this type of model please help me to achieve this in Jenkins Output Console.
The Jenkins Pipeline assigns a separate auto increment build number per branch and pull request which might lead to two builds from different branches having the same version.
i am running into a situation where i am trying to run a terraform (/code/) script within jenkins within kubernetes (k8s) within an ec2-instance.

/pre/  My question is, is there a way to randomize And share this port (not fixed to 8090), so concurrent builds on Jenkins server can run tests and not fail because address is in use already.
But I want to use it in jenkins groovy sh function.
So I 'd found the Jenkins process which was running on port: 8080 using: /code/ and killed it using /code/(66 was process id).
I do not currently have Jenkins, so I cannot really test all the methods, but technically you can test if the chain works by: .
My suggestion is to parametrize the server port in the POM and application-test.properties files, and set a value based upon some Jenkins-provided variable: For example, /code/, which is incremented on every build and thus uniqueness is guranteed.
I tried to build a job in jenkins using python jenkinsapi, I tried passing nested dict as a parameter to build the job, .

I am new in Jenkins pipeline,my task is to create the aws cloud formation stack using cft and stack name should be random number between 1-9999, for that i am using shuf command to generate number and stored in variable.
But every time I would click on "View Configuration" for any job, Jenkins would take north of 35 seconds to fully load the page.
Maybe your application (dockerized jenkins) uses another port like 80   Could you exec netstat -plnt inside of your docker container to detect what is the true port?
My query here is if i have to stop the script execution, how can i sent the signal to the script to stop from Jenkins itself?
In that way, I can start docker commands inside the Jenkins container.
/pre/  Am I missing a sorting parameter that is default on Jenkins Inputs?
The only solution I see is running the test script multiple times from Jenkins to have concurrency.
Future Plan: To implement it using Jenkins pipelines (even though it might be long way to get there for me) .
- which is very likely the case, then you need to use the opposite approach: jenkins periodically polling git repository.
In jenkins before the execute edeliver write this code: .
Even though the command does n't require sudo rights,  it requires it when run with jenkins.
I even tried removing the "SonarScanner for MSBuild " begin/end analysis steps and manually executing Windows batch commands (which is working fine outside of Jenkins).
"sequential" is n't a keyword you can use in Jenkins pipelines, but the steps are executed sequentially unless they are in a paralell block anyway, so you should n't need it.
First off - the EFS mount point directory (/var/jenkins_home) required permissions of 777, it does n't need to be a recursive permission.
The 2 CFT 's are part of a jenkins pipeline and its possible that the playbook that uses the CFT to create the EBS volume can be skipped and thus there is no EbsVolumeId to reference.
When I run this test method from jenkins, the shell script is getting executed.
Fixed my issue, before I was giving argument in '-v ____ ' + '-v ____ ' + ... form, and for some reason the jenkins docker workflow plugin was scrambling the order of this arguments.
If the above is not possible, is there a way to write groovy script to call Jenkinsfiles within Jenkins job .
I have parameterized job with 'list' MultiSelect parameter in Jenkins: /url/ .
I 'm executing a set of commands through Jenkins by Execute Windows Batch Command.
The simplest and fastest solution will be to rename by pattern right after you Gradle command in your Jenkins job something along the lines of /code/  .

How can I run a MongoDB docker image, run the tests and then kill it using Jenkins Pipeline?
I have data on Jenkins Job Pipeline Executions and I am trying to determine the average duration it takes to go from Development to Production based upon the start and end times in the data.
As part of the build process in Jenkins, i need to launch a VM, do some testing on it and shutdown the VM.
/url/ has the list of environment variables which gets injected automatically when a Jenkins job is triggered by a gerrit event, but if Jenkins is started manually with a gerrit number as input parameter, how to fetch those GERRIT_* env variables and inject?
This one works in Jenkins Script Console .
I am trying to get metrics for each individual job on Jenkins (I have 100 plus jobs).
Have you considered rewriting your Jenkins chain as a single /url/?
I did 5 so I could pass parameters from a Jenkins Windows Batch step (this was a freestyle job before I fully migrated to pipeline in current role which started in Jan 2018) to two DOS batch script I wrote to  .
I also encounter such problem when I use the multibranch pipeline, it happens because jenkins needs to serialize the procedures such as step or stage at some point in case that jenkins restart, so it can reprocess those procedures.
Look job function to launch other Jenkins Job in parallel : /url/ .

I need some assistance to convert some Jenkins pipeline script code to Python.
Reason for converting this code is that I have ssh to a remote host using Febric in Jenkins pipeline and I need to run pipeline script inside Febric which is Python based.
However, you can define a set of functions in groovy and load them into a jar, then 'bless' that jar (install into Jenkins) as a set of approved functions so that they can run inside Jenkins pipeline jobs.
Since I did n't manage the Jenkins I needed functions for (and it had none already), doing a local walkthrough made it possible to describe to the admins exactly what was needed in my 'bless' request, and they seemed to appreciate that.
This plugin enables you run Oracle SQL*Plus scripts on your Jenkins   jobs (user defined scripts or a script inside a workspace).
At first the /var/progres-data and /var/jenkins_home are not existing.
For the Jenkins python API /code/ method, I think you need to look at the /code/ parameter: .
Is the way I add the arguments in Jenkins startup correct?
(In Windows, I just modified jenkins.xml, also used arguments with "-", while here seems "-" is not needed?)
4) Jenkins can make call to SaltMaster to reconfigure VM attributes (disc size etc.)
I 'm wondering if there is a way to merge a branch to master automatically  after Jenkins test ends up successfully.
You are interested in understanding how you can send arguments to the Java process you run in Jenkins.
I use shared libraries for Jenkins pipeline and here is a piece of that shared library with pipeline and  using of methods to get counts: .
Write-Host is not allowed in Jenkins jobs and is generally considered not well suited for the task.
/pre/  I load this file into another Groovy file as part of my Jenkins pipeline and call get_job_permissions passing through one of the enums as a parameter.
Jenkins does n't do any magic, it basically checks out /url/ and executes build steps (most likely you will run JMeter using /url/) .
/pre/  I must confess I saw no significant difference to my Jenkins shutdown time.
Maybe it 's got something to do with that /code/ and /code/ at the start and end of your file (which I assume is something to do with "Jenkins pipeline" syntax as it makes no sense for a shell script).
In a Jenkins post-build groovy script, is there a way to have the /url/ function time out after a certain period of time?
2. after CI job done, jenkins further calculates real code size, if code size less than defined threshold, jenkins auto update new code approval label; if still big than threshold, leave the code approval label to management team to approve.
In some cases your Jenkins jobs may be light on Jenkins but high on some other system, so you want to limit it for that system.
I have just started looking into a shared libarary with jenkins in order to combine a load of scripts and pipelines across multiple repos that are pretty much identical.
You can define JENKINS_HOME variable in the system variables , once you will restart the jenkins via tomcat or any other way, the jenkins will pickup the environment variable and unload the files on new jenkins_home .
/pre/  These tests are running as part of a jenkins plan inside a docker container, to ensure the exact same environment all the time.
However the Jenkins Job B should be triggered only after 10 mins and I should not wait in Job A as i will hold the resources that will be used by other jobs.
I have a pipeline in Jenkins that calls a groovy script which does some important stuff and after its finished doing that stuff it runs a shell command which is supposed to run another shell script.
The assert implementation for Jenkins Pipeline CPS can be found /url/, while the real groovy implementation uses /url/ class during the assert evaluation in order to record values and print proper exception.
In order to get similar behaviour in Jenkins pipeline CPS one would either need to refactor the groovy code base and Jenkins CPS code or duplicate a lot of the functionality in the AssertionWriter class linked above.
Question: is there a rule for how to properly escape command substitution chains from a Jenkins pipeline step that I 'm unaware of?
I tried to run the following code on jenkins to convert a file to string and then convert the string to byte stream.
The jenkins job failed because of OutOfMemoryError[java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space].
When I get inside the container that i have in jenkins  it runs my tests also.
It is working in jenkins pipeline job but not in dsl(throws error at first line where @libary() or library "libname" is used) .
Jenkins Job Type 1 .

Some process, crons, scripts or applications like jenkins needs to execute sudo commands.
Still waiting to schedule task ‘Jenkins’ doesn’t have label ‘packer’ .
I have groovy jenkins pipeline step and I want to pass for loop value as parameter to multiline /code/ script in loop.
But, I guess - your jenkins job, at certain time, required more memory than the container has.
Ultimately, I want Jenkins to run an executable jar which in turn executes the parallel tests.
The idea is that Jenkins will fire off something akin to this -->> "java -jar MyCompiledTests.jar" ... and this would run the code above which allows the tests to run in parallel.
I 'd still like any tips about how to efficiently code Jenkins pipelines.
WORKSPACE is an variable provided by jenkins whos value in my case for the job is /code/.
Pre-compute all 232=4,294,967,296 reversal possibilities in advance, and simply fetch the reverse Jenkins when it is needed.
This is the highest collision rate during brute force reversal of Jenkins hash.
I want to run Jenkins scripted pipeline job at the specified slave at the moment when no other job is running on it.
how to use choice parameter in Jenkins declarative pipeline in batch command.
At the end of your jenkins script, you could evaluate : .
2)I am using "Execute Shell" of Jenkins to run the test cases where I have fired the command by going to that particular folder and running command gradle test .
I initially thought it may be something to do with jenkins not injecting the variable to subsequent builds.
How to enable "Add timestamps to the Console Output" option as one time process to all Jobs as I have more jobs in Jenkins?
Jenkins uses a "Winstone", which is (nowadays) just a wrapper around the Jetty servlet container.
One more detail, being a jenkins I need to run the script that does this in bash.
/pre/  So how do I handle the case where a project 's jenkins file does n't pass any arguments to this function?

In my case, I have some command line args in the jenkins job which takes file input as parameter.
/pre/  Where you only need to replace $FILE_PATH and the rest of parameters are known to Jenkins.
I was under the impression that the Jenkins pipeline choices syntax supported only a static newline-separated list of options and does not currently support dynamic population as the result of a groovy function (returning a map, say).
I 'm getting different results in jenkins pipeline when trying to sort a list compared to jenkins script console.
/pre/  Provided that the code works on jenkins script consolei 'm not sure why the pipeline is giving different results.
When one of both ports is already used by the system like in your case, Jenkins wo n't start.
/pre/  PS: Jenkins2.122 .
But Jenkins runs as service with system account which is most likely using a different date format like for example English U.S. resulting in date string /code/.
In case we execute SWTBot test suite on remote vitual machine without Jenkins.
Solution is fairly simple - extract your Groovy code to a function annotated with /code/ so Jenkins executes it outside CPS mode.
What I meant to say is that even if I write all my performance test cases in /code/ block in the same Unit test bundle (scheme), will it make any difference once the project grows and is subjected to continuous integration in Jenkins?
This way I could avoid the /code/ and also successfully run all test on Jenkins.
You need to whitelist the method call in jenkins scripts approval /url/ .
I have successfully deployed the containers one at a time through Jenkins.
Bit of explanation: the git parameter plugin only knows how to go out and get the list of branches, then put the selected value into a variable (which is basically how all Jenkins parameters work).
Or is there a more effective way to run a python file on both OS in Jenkins?
Limitations of the current setup of jobs means Jenkins has one node/executor (/code/) and I 'd like to support using Docker for nodes to alleviate this bottleneck.
Migrate jobs to run on the "docker cloud" until all jobs support running on child container nodes, then move the configuration from Jenkins to the pipeline build file for each job and turn on parallel builds on the /code/ node.
I am using Jenkins-X for a relatively large project, which consists of approximately 30 modules, 15 of which are services (and therefore, contain Dockerfiles, and a respective Helm chart for deployment).
/pre/  How can I update these variables using Jenkins environment variables?
The best way I could think of is somehow make Jenkins export this as environment variable that is accessible within makefile when build is going on.
in jenkins pipeline the /code/ - is a variable that holds list of environment variables:  .
/pre/  I 'm using the 64 bit Jenkins hash function for key generation.
Even Jenkins did build first target!
If yes, I just append row in Jenkins step.
Note that for jenkins admins both works all the time.
While we are at it, we ca n't access environment variables set on Jenkins in our Kotlin library, is there a way we can fix this?

I have created a bash script as I want to Start and Stop Virtual machines by a Jenkins Job.
How can I execute shell command in jenkins with injectable variables and quotes, example: .
This explains what Jenkins is doing under the hood with the /code/ variable in pipeline scripts, and why your iteration is happening over a /code/ 's characters, and not the list like you might expect.
/pre/  The command line needs to be exactly as the following, otherwise it does not work: C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins>jenkins.exe start .
Windows Server 2016, Jenkins 2.107.1.

I used a batch job in Jenkins with something like the following code: .
What I want to do is to pass Jenkins environment variables to docker container.
/pre/  I want to see the Jenkins environment variables in docker container.
In almost all real cases, Jenkins must require some type of communication with target servers like, tomcat, jboss, containers, etc .
Approach 1: Copy files from jenkins host to container .
In this case, Jenkins does not need a low level communication (ssh) with your docker container.
I am running Jenkins(v2.134) as a docker container managed by Rancher(v1.6.16); and i am using haproxy(HA-Proxy version 1.6.3 2015/12/25) as my loadbalancer.
Jenkins JNLP port is configured as 50000. haproxy got the rule for TCP port forwarding(8081 > 50000) .
IMPORTANT: It is safe to remove the workspace for a given Jenkins job as long as the job is not currently running!
Jenkins plugins ca n't be used  for Selenium tests on Windows when display resolutions is instead 1036*660.
My particular requirement is, if a test was working fine till 100th jenkins build, and stated failing from 101, till 129 (today), it should show the age as "29 Builds (Or something)" Is there a way to achieve this using Allure ?
I have a jenkins job to execute my tests each time we have an official release.
"Use MapR" is n't quite clear to me because I just view it as Hadoop at the end of the day, but you can effectively make your Jenkins slave an "edge node" by installing only the Hadoop Java (maybe also MapR) client utilities plus any XML configuration files from the other edge nodes that define how to communicate with the cluster.
This value can only be modified by the /url/, as of jenkins-2.143.
/pre/  How can I deploy the container and let it running for either unlimited time until stopped or atleast for the whole time jenkins is running?
Jenkins does have an option to start job externally, e.g., from a script, or in your case from a docker file.
I have performance tests made by Jmeter , then i loaded all of them on github and run on Jenkins.
So - could I and how make summary report on Item element page in jenkins , or how can i just show in same item element page in Jenkins local directory (named like  'results') ?
When /code/-ing the file on a locally cloned shallow repository of depth 5 I see only one hash while when I run a jenkins job to clone the same repo at depth 5 I see multiple hashes.
We used the parallel steps in pipeline and lets Jenkins queue and execute the application.
The limitation in Jenkins is currently with massive parallel jobs (/url/).
And main problem: Jenkins will start the execution of parallel pipeline part-jobs only after finishing adding all to the queue.
For single functions it looks great, but for the complete run like we have in Jenkins => Deploy and collect results looks complex .
/pre/  As a side note: remember to escape /code/ if you want to pass it to the sh command - Jenkins strips single escape character, so if you want to pass e.g.
I wish I knew why it was n't able to see it but I do n't have time to diagnose it as the Jenkins Envionemnt Variables meets my needs (and is n't a major compromise).
However, I actually only have one repository and no idea why Jenkins recognises it as multiple.
I want to run UI tests and unit tests on a project in CI (Jenkins Pipeline).
You can tell this from how the command are written in your Jenkins output - everything you have there should be one command, not two separate entries.
As you also pointed out, Docker is better for the job but DiD might be overkill, instead use your own host to start a Jenkins server inside a Docker container.
When running jobs in a Jenkins Pipeline in parallel (multi node setup) with the /code/ keyword, the output of the individual nodes is interleaved.
Outside of the Docker container in the host, I have a bash script that I would like to run from a Jenkins pipeline inside of the container and get the result of the bash script.
/pre/  Currently what happens is if I configure the "env.testVar" to have a value of "dog" from within jenkins the print statements will be: .
Part 1 :  Yes, you can run ShellScript(Shell Commands) from Jenkins /url/.
Jenkins work on the environment variables rather than putting this into /code/ you can put this in Environment variable and use the environment variables to send the mail.
Do n't know if this was available at the time of the question, but Job.invoke() and/or Jenkins.build_job() return a QueueItem object, which can block_until_building(), or block_until_complete() .
Builds (can be thought of as "instances of executions") in Jenkins are independent of each other.
Jenkins will always stop and remove the container, once the body of your /code/ command is finished.
and you have a pipeline in jenkins which use multiple jobs as part of the build process: preliminary job that compile all modules, and then, additional job that runs the integrations test by executing a maven command on the integration tests module.
I found an example on Sam Jenkins, and tried a few variations, but I keep having this result.
/pre/  I purposely do n't do the /code/ on Jenkins since I want to test locally first .
/pre/  You 're asking Jenkins to collect the environment variables now (at the time of the collect() method execution) and store them on this buildInfo instance.
I have a string parameter in jenkins called '/code/'.

If i run groovy code from Jenkins, It should return: .
I have 2 pipelines one for review and one for deploy  so when the pipeline ends with review i want to skip jenkins file execution  but when ends with deploy it should execute the stage or the jenkins file  i tried to use if but this is declarative pipeline so when shoud be use i want to avoide execution of stage using when condition if i encounter deploy pipeline end .
Can I do something at Jenkins job pipeline level to acchive this ??
At the moment I 'm testing some scripts made by a co-worker and I just want jenkins to run ant commands to check if the scripts structure are correct.
Ho ever jenkins always returns  .
The text box in Jenkins expects command line arguments for Scanner for MSBuild, which are in the form /code/.

Currently i have a job which executes 100+ test cases on 1 Jenkins slave and it runs for approximately 10 hours, How to split the test cases and run on multiple slaves and get 1 single report?
/pre/  When running the Jenkins Pipeline, the initialization (where the Dockerfile is consumed and run) does not seem to match up with the steps.
I have noticed that Jenkins can run various stages in sequence or in parallel via a Pipeline.
This is my Jenkinsfile inside of the repo which I do n't think jenkins has n't been able to get to that point because of the timeout set to 10 minutes, which I ca n't change: .
Machine 1 receives some parameters from Jenkins (used for JMeter tests).
When I run the code from the IDE, it works perfectly but when I run it as a part of a step in Jenkins, it only reads 10000 lines of the total which is approximately 2.8 million lines.
Since its run in background jenkins job will not going to wait &amp; will move to next stage .
As the beginning -- I currently set up Jenkins with 3 nodes (macOS 10.13, macOS 10.14, Ubuntu 14.04) labeled /code/ and /code/.
We had many freestyle Jenkins jobs which were polling our internal SVN repository every minute (about 200 of them).
There is currently a single Jenkins job with a build parameter (dropdown) of all services.
Say, I have 2 Jenkins-Jobs (it might get more) A and B. I am unsing Jenkins version 2.138.2. .
Example: When I run my jenkins jobs with build parameter for example am entering phone number as 567 it should replace the value in the testdata.properties .
/pre/  Is it possible to set the above parameters from Jenkins job by passing the build as String parameter or something ?
There might be a way to whitelist your Jenkins in Proofpoint, but I 'm pretty sure that there is nothing to be done in Jenkins.
All the existing answers I 've found have involved either "make it happen every time as part of the pipeline" or "run a script on the server" - surely there 's a way in the Jenkins GUI to say "zap this workspace so we can build clean next time"?
I have problems with Jenkins when I am programming a task that executes a windows command.
This plugin allows filtering Jenkins' console output by means of regular expressions.
You can use jenkins pipeline in order to run this job if the status is not SUCCESS.
1.How to replace back slash with forward slash in Jenkins on UI :- SVN_EAR_PATH (String parameter) /url/ .
How can I get the SVN_REVISION number as environment variable or alternatively a simple solution to retrieve it in jenkins as a parameter?
/pre/  I have used /code/ inside the stage on purpose, because this is not a Jenkins pipeline step, but simple Groovy method.
The declarative pipeline does not allow you to put Groovy code inside /code/ block - it expects a valid Jenkins pipeline step in this place.
This is probably not what you want in this case since Jenkins is providing that dependency at runtime.
I need to setup some jenkins jobs that probe the cluster every X minutes, and make sure everything is working and functional.
The recommended way to start Jenkins on Ubuntu (16.04 and 18.04) is using:  .
I would like to know if it 's possible to pass a variable define in a jenkins pipeline job to a loaded script like.
Since I have less number of Jenkins jobs, I am thinking about going for a single node/master only Jenkins deployment.
Yes, you can have jobs (in Jenkins or something) that will automatically rebase your deviations against a master branch, but when it comes to tooling, you are on your own.
I 'm trying to have my Jest tests (unit tests) for my React code (frontend) run as part of my Jenkins pipeline.

@gingerlime I had a similar situation with our Jenkins on GCP, we 're using ChefDK 3.1.0 (ruby embeed 2.5.1p57) -- tried other also, over a Jenkins that was running over /code/ (Ubuntu 16.04) and /code/ (Ubuntu 14.04) -- we tried on both versions, right now running over 16.04 in /code/ kernel version, running a few jobs with /code/ and this problem always emerge in a few situations.
The jenkins job which was running the docker run command had a space in it and as a result docker engine was not able to understand the docker run command.
I have a bash function that calls a curl command to perform some jenkins operation(remove a shelved projects) .
But when I try to run the same code using Jenkins, the tests fails and brings me this result  .
I 'm trying the first steps using Jenkins, but did not succeed managing the first pipeline test.
I try to connect a VM(Windows 10) as a node in jenkins with ssh.
Remember that your jenkins job is running in its own container.
We then had the idea that the previous commit it should be comparing against is the Parent SHA, not necessarily the last Jenkins build which may or may not be on the same branch.
I even tried to schedule a jenkins job that basically does the same thing - it did not work - the jenkins job waits forever while post_results.bat (I killed the jenkins job after waiting for ~20 min).
I killed it to see if that helps, But to my serprise, this did not help rather the situation is now worse and the top command "top -U jenkins" now gives following result (and the number of processes are ever growing) .
I 'm using the Jenkins UI and I want to let the test fail if at least one of multiple regex occur in the console output.
You are trying to run Jenkins on Java 11.
/pre/  I do n't think Jenkins is capable of expanding variables in the environment block and I think it is leaving your PATH variable completely empty.
The combination of single quote and /code/ does n't seem to work, I assume the double quote makes Jenkins expand the variable (as a Groovy variable, I guess) instead of the operating system.
If yes, are you able to telnet 192.168.1.33 22 from Jenkins master ?

But I wanted to set the global environment variable in a Jenkins Pipeline Job that shared among all Jenkins Job.
We knew that this rewrite was extreme and risky, but our patience with the current state of the code had finally run out, and the mood in the room was reminiscent of Leeroy Jenkins.
This is important for Jenkins: I do n't want the build to fail in the first step if I do the linking.
Now, my question is, how can I pass this ${version} variable dynamically from jenkins job?
Can anyone help me why jenkins uses 2 processors for this job at the same time ?
I have a Jenkins job that starts a python program on a cluster via SSH from a windows slave.
Is there any way to get Jenkins to simply interrupt a child process and wait for it to finish?
/pre/  Both master jenkins container and slave run in the same name space.
My Jenkins pipeline job is not parameterized, but while calling the job from a pipeline script I can provide parameters that are getting used inside my current job.
But since I 'm running PHP unit tests in the scripts, I 'm a bit suspicious that this part, because in the Jenkins this was done very quickly (on my local computer running unit testing with coverage report takes ~20min), failed, or did n't run as it should.
I assume that this may be the reason why jenkins needs 2 build cores (one for each docker agent) in your case, altough I 'm not sure.
As soon as the script completes execution, I need to get the value of the variable /code/ and send it as part of Jenkins email.
You can use /code/ as a workaround to generate multiple test output files, jenkins will automatically compile the results together.
I do n't think Jenkins can do this monitoring for you, in the end, it 's just a big, distributed, job scheduler and runner.
However, /code/ and all other methods that are part of the Jenkins Declarative DSL will execute on the current build server where the job is being performed and in the workspace.
Groovy methods within global vars will still execute on the Jenkins master.
How to ensure a stage is executed in a flyweight Jenkins executor?
/pre/  In the stage /code/ I designated /code/, which, to my understanding, means that Jenkins would use a flyweight executor for this stage.
But still, the executor is heavyweight during the stage and uses up one of the valuable executors on the Jenkins slave.
My Jenkins pipeline job is not parameterized, but while calling the job from a pipeline script I can provide parameters that are getting used inside my current job.
I quickly tested on Jenkins version 2.146 and it does n't work on my end as it says it does n't recognize the property PLATFORM in the downstream job.
/pre/  If I comment out the second command, and run it in the Jenkins Script console, it runs fine and I can print the security group name.
However, we have some "utility" scripts in Jenkins which are in reality outside of the natural lifecycle.
I have few questions about how to use the Jenkins Job Builder, especially, with the !join operator.
I would like to only update the "parameters" section in a Jenkins job and not the entire job.
I have personally done this with Jenkins and it was pretty straight-forward and took a few hours to get it up and running.
To sum up the conversation in the comments: in order for Jenkins to build your code you need to tell it how to build your code.
I 'm writing a number of e2e tests that can integrate into Jenkins so that they run whenever new code is committed.
Also, another thing in Jenkins Pipeline Dsl for Openshift (/url/), how can one do a condition to test if a service is already expose, something like if (service.IsExpose)?
When I execute the command on the jenkins node by hand, it works as expected .

It 's running from Jenkins via a Powershell step, the input param /code/ is configured as a "Muli-line String".
The anchore Jenkins plugin will add an image, then poll the engine for image status/evaluation for the configured number of tries (default 300).
This is separated to make it more readable but I have this running on a single line in Jenkins.
I was on Jenkins 2.22 and wanted to upgrade to 2.153.
So you 'd pass that variable through in your Jenkins Build step .
/pre/  In Jenkins environment, /code/ variable is represented not by a map, but by /url/ which means it does not even support /code/ or /code/ methods.
Other things: pipeline build step version 2.5.1, Jenkins 2.46.2 .
I am running my selenium tests in IE in a Windows VM with the help of Jenkins.
I would like to schedule a Jenkins task to run on the first Tuesday of March and September sometime in the 3am hour.
I have a problem in my pipelines on Jenkins, when my code is cloned from Bitbucket, it takes a lot of time performing this line: .
/pre/  Jenkins when perform my stage execute all this tasks: .
groovy.lang.MissingMethodException: No signature of method:   java.lang.String.call() is applicable for argument types:   (java.lang.String) values: [Jenkins] .
The easiest way to do is to run /code/ from the jenkins server by hand.
I want to write a jenkins pipeline job which uses a parameter of type  "List Subversion Tags (and more)".
Note that there are a number of third party solutions that have a huge number of followers such as Bamboo, Octopus, Jenkins, Chef, etc.
This tool can do variable substitution in config files and you can define variables per environment (and much more...)  The deployment of the entire solution now wake about 15 minutes and the end result is always good...  You can also trigger release creation and deployment directly form TFS, VSTS, Jenkins or TeamCity, so that you could have a very solid CI/CD approach.
Not in this case, since it is purely on demand: you can execute the script through a simple ssh call, no need for Jenkins.
However, for some reason when running this groovy script as part of a jenkins pipeline, it breaks up the map into single characters.
I wanted to run a jenkins job by accepting a date  and time field (in format YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm) from user.
I have Jenkins V2.7 with a freestyle project running on Windows 7, One of the build steps is “Execute Windows batch command”, in this step I run some .exe which do some stuff and also set environment variable TEST to Z:\DATA Recently I have updated Jenkins and plugins to V2.144 and now when I run the job the TEST variable is set to Z:DATA instead of Z:\DATA .
This is due to the way how groovy scripts are evaluated in jenkins.
The solution is as it is for Jenkins: before performing the JGitFlow operation, make a checkout.
I need to overload jenkins functions to debug pipeline script in IDE.
1-Jenkins Integrats the SQLWorkbench which calls the one /code/.
Note that all of the things I 've tried work fine on the command line and/or via crontab (I 'm trying to use jenkins instead of crontab though...) .
Your question is a bit unclear but try to call the bat script from your Jenkins job with a key value pair: .
first day I created Jenkins job by using my DSL script.
/pre/  You will also need to copy a proper /code/ file, to ensure the first /code/ will work without asking to type /code/ on the command line (impossible from a jenkins job).
This is usually fine since there 's a lot of downtime on the machines, but if the Jenkins pipeline is run at the same time it causes timeouts to kick in because the code takes too long to run.
$rootPassword,$isRoot, $Host are Jenkins string parameter .
I feel like both approaches do the same thing running jenkins slaves /node on a docker container, but I am not sure.
But if I have 20 UITests that means I 'll have 20 different Jenkins projects in my dashboard, one for each UITest (per device, per platform).
It seems that with 20 UITests I 'll end up with over 100 Jenkins projects.
Could anyone describe the steps to run python selenium test on jenkins.
I use Jenkins job to run monthly some DB tests.
After reading about Jenkins format, I try to schedule build for every last day of every month like this:  .
Current Jenkins Windows Batch Command .
I knew we can see these changes individually from localhost:8080/jenkins/job/Job_name/224/ but I want to see whole information in one single form.
Short: Can I set the name of a Jenkins job created automatically by the Multibranch Pipeline job, to something calculated in the job itself?
/pre/  I always get the output as /code/ and not the actual Jenkins build number.
Jenkins parallel blocks are great but they do raise the bar for human comprehension as they interleave output.
Once nodereuse has been set to false, the waiting time at the end of jenkins job vanished.
I 'm having some trouble understanding how to pass a string which needs to contain spaces and quotes through a jenkins parameter to an execute shell command.
Trying to move from Java 8 to 11, but Jenkins does n't run under 11.
I 'm going to run jenkins under my java8 instance.
Since this includes the jenkins image, it seems quite large.
I am going to need the jenkins image anyway, but wondered if there is a better practice or standard to save just the volume data?
I have a Jenkins job with the following arguments variable.
I have to create job that executes multiple job on jenkins.
I need to use one job to trigger other jobs in jenkins, all jobs have one parameter with same name, let 's call it "server_name", then I installed "Parameterized Trigger Plugin" and select "Trigger/call builds on other projects" and add "Current build parameters" to pass "server_name" to all sub jobs, everything works well now.
My question is how to fail jenkins build inside PS script, when condition not met?
I used the above script in jenkins Execute Shell window.
/tmp/jenkins371454092166709762.sh: line 23: [!
Rather than trying to limit which branches Jenkins is polling firstly what I do in my Jenkinsfile is poll source control every minute: .
It would be nice to run a debugger inside the jenkins environment, or going step by step through the pipeline script and see how it is actually working without a print in every second line.
I would like to build a Pipeline in Jenkins where result based on multiple upstream jobs should trigger a single downstream job.
Jenkins is able to collapse multiple triggers in case of several executions in the queue.
In Jenkins, If one build is currently running and next one is in pending state then what should i do so that running one should get aborted and next pending one should start running and so on.
I would like to create a Jenkins job which would trigger Matlab function.
By default Jenkins runs on ports 8080 or 8443.
Can i have a job run on any group of slaves whose capabilities match the Job requirements in jenkins.
First you need to run the jenkins container   "docker start (container-name or container-id)" .
But when I type CTRL+C from the command line, the jenkins service goes down.
However, after my build is done, the VM gets shutdown by Jenkins shortly after, in the range of a minute or two, not the 120 minutes specified.
If not how do you check for windows or linux inside of a jenkins job dsl script?
I am trying to run a windows batch file by jenkins on slave windows machine.
Takes 10 mins to setup against your Jenkins Instance.
I would like to run job in Jenkins tool on every Wednesday morning at 7AM BST.. what 's correct expression needs to use in Build Triggers?
/pre/  But, it 's not works when I using "Execute Shell" in jenkins to execute it.
/pre/  I thought since it works on the command line, if I just add the location of the batch file to jenkins and let it execute it, it should work, but it doesnt.
/pre/  How would I code this in a Jenkins pipeline so the single-quotes and double-quotes in the --default-actions string are preserved?
basically I am trying to run the test from Jenkins GitHub code and updating my test execution in test-link.
The second link is is about running a jenkins agent as a docker container and running tools inside the container against your code.
Is there any Real time Test Reporter to view the test results during the execution in Jenkins.
Although Avner 's answer is correct, I found out that the window and buffer size has to be re-defined each time your jenkins pipeline hits a new powershell step.
Note: I have done the same thing for Jenkins: .
/pre/  Then your jenkins pipeline template in /code/ can use those closure blocks: .
Second reason for leaving this appraoch: the general Jenkins image will only execute Functional Tests in specific cases, so not always.
It might sound a bit redundant at first, but combining GitLab CI and Jenkins is quite powerful.
Final word is: the balance leans a little bit towards Jenkins because of its many plugins, but chances are GitLab CI will quickly fill the gap.
I like to pass the environment variable based on index &amp; pass it 's parameter to execute another Jenkins job.
Since Java Strings supports unicode values in Strings, Jenkins can handle the values properly.
Is there any way I can combine all the 4 jobs in a jenkins pipeline and have the same logic of checking if the previous execution successful or not?
Im on Jenkins   2.140 Im loading jobs from github repo I want to have multiple Jenkinsfiles that will execute main test with different set of default parameters.
You cannot set a given token explicitly since Jenkins only stores the hash of a token.
If jenkins is to launch a long running process (say a docker container running a webserver) then the shell command line must be able to start and then have its exit status tell jenkins pipeline if the start was successful.
A somewhat easier approach is to have some other tool allow you to easily test on the commandline and then have jenkins build the environment in which to run that command line process.
We do the same thing (use one jenkins file that is trigger multiple times with different param) .
/pre/  For Windows you can use execute windows batch command in jenkins .
this is my first time using Jenkins for automated test.I 've tried to run a test by integrate Newman with Jenkins but I always get the  .
I need to get jenkins all master/child job details like start time, end time, review id which got integrated in current jenkin job for all the master and children jobs and put the same in a json array.
How can I write a conditional step with boolean parameter in Jenkins scripted pipeline ?
With this option, each time you restart your machine you will have to manually connect it to the jenkins node through a Java applet.
There are no jenkins build jobs running at this time.
Then, Probably You are talking about these two:  - Jenkins Pipeline (/url/)  - Periodic Build (/url/)  .
For anything but the most basic queries, I usually prefer to run a small groovy script that will extract the required data from Jenkins' internal structures.
In the end, I would like Jenkins to build every task in a rhythm of 15 minutes.
a different "parent" Jenkins job, that triggers this job while iterating through an array.
It seems that with 20 UITests I 'll end up with over 100 Jenkins projects.
The goal is to write a local pipeline script for jenkins and use it in my pipeline (I 'm using version 2.138).
I was wondering whats the best approach to Schedule a Jenkins pipeline to run every n amount of time or at a specific time of day.
Somehow generate a value from 0 to 7 inside my pipeline groovy script and use that value to run the shell script and call it through a Jenkins Job.
Just to clarify things are working for me when running from jenkins but I need an easy way to write my jenkins file with the usage of functions from the shared-lib repo.
you should see the jenkins container is up and 8090/50001 are accessible: .
From my local computer, I can reach ports 50001 and 8090 while Jenkins is being set up.
Once the output of the /code/ command tells me that Jenkins is set up, the website at port 8090 is no longer reachable, but port 50001 is still reachable.
But next day when i tried to open the jenkins on 192.168.43.75:8090.
I would like to change the way we approach git in our Jenkins (version 2.89.4).
In case of SaaS our Jenkins pipelines will directly deploy (whether they are web apps, azure/lambda functions).
At certain moment of time I had to build Jenkins pipeline where POM files should be reverted each time the job starts.
I have a multibranch pipeline set up in Jenkins that runs a Jenkinsfile, which uses pytest for testing scripts, and outputs the results using Cobertura plug-in and checks code quality with Pylint and Warnings plug-in.
you can define the whole pipeline in a single jenkins file where each python test is a different stage (they can be run one after another or concurrently) .
But when I use python tempfile or python jenkins API ,server return a 500 error.
/pre/  Even though the /code/ script exit with code 1, the Jenkins job execution continues to the next step.
Unit test using Jenkins Pipeline Unit .
Are jenkins parameters (accessed from Groove code as env.VARNAME) case-insensitive?
Wait for the job execution (via Jenkins REST API).
I set up a Windows Jenkins 2.156 and everythings works fine.
We 're trying to read a list of steps from a configuration file (stored in json format) and execute some actions bases on it in jenkins pipeline script.
The Free Swap Space on my on the azure node in jenkins says its on 0B, but there is 26,99GB of Free Temp Space.
Is there a way to tell Jenkins to skip the /code/ argument?
I have a Jenkins server that should offload the execution of larger tests to an HPC cluster:  .
Now, if I want to execute this within a Jenkins pipeline, things do n't work.
If I use the "-T" option for the SSH command, the command executes, and exits before anything else is done, and then I am back on the Jenkins master node, so I am not executing the commands that are responsible for starting the test.
I have some jenkins pipelines that build a VUE.js application using node js.
Below is my test case that I am executing on Jenkins  .
/pre/  I have a Jenkins job that has the "Poll SCM" option enabled with the following cronjob (10 7,9,11,13,15,17,19 * * 1-5) .
/pre/  I observe that only first nested part of system-out displayed on jenkins, but not the second part.
We would like to "merge" or migrate the feature branch jenkins test results into the jenkins test results for /code/.
/pre/  However, when I attempt to run the same command from my Jenkins container, Jenkins returns:  .
You can have Jenkins create new nodes from a template and name them with an incrementing counter (i.e.
I have also configured the Performance plugin of Jenkins to display the report after JMeter script execution.
i am running jenkins as follows: (in other words as a docker container on a centos vm), note that this command has privileged flag, i was trying to see if this would make a difference, but not.
I am running this on a windows jenkins node.
I am running some performance tests from Jenkins.
In case of SaaS our Jenkins pipelines will directly deploy (whether they are web apps, azure/lambda functions).
So when sing a standard jenkins/jenkins:2.150.1 within an ubuntu 18.04 this is not working unfortunately.
I am calling a shell script with some parameters within 'Execute Shell' build step in Jenkins.
I have two tasks running in a single task definition (set up the desired count of that service to 2 ), I am using Jenkins for continuous deployment.
I have tried to write a "bash script" with for loop to iterate the "current task" variable but not working with the Jenkins format.
/pre/  any idea how for use the "for loop" with Jenkins to stop both the running task?
We have some UATs (user acceptance tests) which run in Jenkins with the Chromedriver, and some of them do not run anymore since the protractor (Javascript Angular UI-Test framework) cannot set browser-width size under 552px.
I 'm using Unity 2018.2.18f1 with jenkins 2.138.3 and the unity3d plugin 1.3 on Ubuntu 18.04.1 .
/pre/  One of these scripts will be executed from jenkins job and that executes the other script.
In jenkins i 'm first running a normal sonarcloud scan, .
But when I run the CI flow, from Jenkins console output, it will list extra hundreds branchs with name origin/merge-requests/xxx, xxx is the number from 1 to 156 in my case.
Adding onto the answer by @Szymon-Stepniak -- once you have a jenkins instance running .
You can then export the value of the result as the environment variable for the Jenkins configuration.
In your Jenkins build, add a 'batch command' item which runs that python script with the appropriate parameters.
Is there any way I can get that in jenkins pipeline?
/pre/  It 's just a temporary solution though, you 'll have to run the command again if you restart Jenkins.
I have a Jenkins Pipeline Code which is too long.
The @tmp folder is there for jenkins job and stages statistics (duration of stages, etc), you can delete it if you want to be sure.
The Seed Job is the one which will be creating other Jenkins job automatically but the seed job itself will be configured manually.
/pre/  So if we pass abc parameter via main pipeline (Jenkins file), build job should pick 10.0.0.3 ip address from parameter list.
/pre/  As you can see, there is an space between "Jenkins:" and "scriptname.sql".
I 'd like to use "$WORSKPACE" variable into a groovy file called by jenkins script.
Since you ca n't run those jobs in one multijob phase, as an alternative You could use Jenkins pipeline job (/url/).
Also, I have installed jenkins from yum on another similar machine without any docker or kubernetes and it 's possible to access it through 10.20.30.40:8080 in my browser so there is no provider firewall preventing me from doing that.
That means that a specific port number, on any node within your cluster, will deliver your Jenkins UI.
This kicks of the Jenkins pipeline and spins up a new node because the autoscaler sees that there are not enough cpu resources on the first node.
You can also use Ansible or Jenkins to do the task in Jenkins you can create a job and it has S3 plugin even available and simply run your Jenkins job which going to copy the logs to your s3 buckets  .
I 'm using the following code in my jenkins pipeline script to stop a particular job from running.
So, my questions is: will the stop and down operations from the first Jenkins task, stop and destroy the second container that started after the first one?
If you ca n't reach all ip/port listed, you will face some random slow loggin (30 or 60 seconds, depend on the query) when the jenkins AD pluggins will try to query those servers/services.
I 'm setting up a Jenkins pipeline with Kubernetes, there is an option to set environment variables for a container in /url/.
The script ends up with the Artifactory build number as a text string '$LATEST_BUILD_NO_SLASH' (for clarity, this is not the Jenkins build number).
I want to trigger these 20 jobs from single jenkins job.
I need to use those 20 jobs as build parameters in single jenkins job so i can choose which job to deploy.
We are using the Jenkins pipeline for the build process and putting the output in /code/, the only problem with that process is that we have to make a separate build for every environment although everything is same except that API environment variable.
As i have configured with Jenkins i cannot run every test case separately.
This can occur when Jenkins is running on top of an operating system with a case-sensitive filesystem, and the filename is correctly spelled but you have mistakenly substituted an upper-case letter for a lower-case letter, or a lower-case letter for an upper-case letter.
The Jenkins version is 2.53 (which is somewhat out of date but I do n't think that it is to blame).
I 'm running a Jenkins 2.140 server on Ubuntu 16.04 as well as an Ansible AWX 1.0.7.2 server using Ansible 2.6.2. .
However when I create the Jenkins job using a seed job which uses the JobDSL, the job fails at the Ansible AWX step with this output: .
Jenkins console output looks like this (see the time difference between first and second line): .
I have a Jenkins Pipeline that executes Job A and Job B. I have 10 agents/nodes on which Job A is executed.
/pre/  I would like to emphasise I am looking for a native Jenkins Job DSL solution and not a Jenkins Pipeline Script one or any other hacky way like manipulation of environment variables.
I am trying a run a a python script though Jenkins.
From Jenkins 2.60.1 (June 2017) LTS on, maven jobs require JDK 1.8 or up.
2.60.1 is the first Jenkins LTS release that requires Java 8 to run.
I even let Jenkins on that screen for a few hours and nothing.
I see Jenkins has the "Last Duration" on there already, but a sparkline of historical duration would be great .
Is there a better way to avoid clone and make my jar somewhere in the jenkins node?
Jenkins realized that a new version was available, but could n't check it out as long as its own time was smaller than the new versions time.
I am new with Jenkins CD and i have several question about running job in parallel: .
My stories: A number of test cases ( 30 cases and i called main task) will be added into a Jenkins job ( called exec job).
Additionally to this, there is a Jenkins /url/ that creates an easy to follow test run history, where you can see the number of tests that failed the most times in the last runs.
It 's almost certainly easier to do this in Jenkins than it is to do it in Python.
jenkins requires all variables in the pipeline to be /url/ because the next step could be executed on other node then the previous one.
Jenkins do n't want to use any variables inside agent docker args section, except main Jenkins variables, such a JENKINS_URL.
You can try writing a script with cron (or using a tool such as Jenkins) that listen to such events (or testing the changes every few minutes) and performs an update for such cases.
From the note immediately below however /code/ I can tell that Jenkins is bookkeeping the pause time.
Now, we want to get Jenkins to use JDK9 in all Pipelins, if the "tools" statement is n't in pipeline 's definition.
Ideally, i would like to keep pure groovy logic under the class hierarchy and limit the globals mostly to jenkins steps, with some objects where necessary.
If you want to compress the old jenkins jobs using the following script mtime +5 means the file change time is 5 days ago .
/pre/  I noticed that on another Windows Jenkins server the private key has a different number of characters per line .
In future this parameter will be used in Jenkins job.
Update: in order to be able to execute this on jenkins(linux instance, in my case), have added a pattern /code/ .
In Jenkins, I would like to upload log files continuously while a python script that generates them runs simultaneously in a parallel build step.
It is better to use jenkins steps  'readFile' and 'writeFile'.
19:31:52  (p4):cmd:... p4 revert C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\workspace\Abhimanyu/...   19:31:52  p4 revert C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\workspace\Abhimanyu/...   19:31:52   19:31:53  C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\workspace\Abhimanyu/... - file(s) not opened on this client.

I am trying to run conditional steps in a Jenkins scripted pipeline, however I am not sure how to only run a step if a previous step was successful.
I am new to Powershell and trying to run a PS script using another PS script to run it as admin in Jenkins, the script gives it 's desired output but it also gives the error in the output.
I am just integrating Protractor end to end test job in my Jenkins.
I am trying to achieve the following task in Jenkins: 1) Build a maven project 2) When running the test cases I print certain messages to the console output 3) Parse the console output of the build and determine if certain patterns exist in the output 4) If the pattern exists I want to label the build with a specific string .
I think I could just do a /code/, but that does n't fit well with my Jenkins pipeline.
I have SOAPUI project with 10 test cases in Jenkins.
I have about 30+ build jobs that run on Jenkins within a docker container.
When the shell commands are executed directly on Jenkins, Linux flavour Debian 9, the commands execute without issue.
I need to run cron job for every 5 seconds through looper/jenkins.
What is more jenkins estimates time completion much more less than usual (30min than roughly 2 hours).
I run this suite on virtual machine with jenkins (Windows Server 2008).
But since you are running jenkins as container, the container cant reach docker host unix port .
I have some Windows Server 2016 instances on GCE (for Jenkins agents).
If you have the Jenkins server URL, job name and job number, you can swap the values into a request like this: .
There are many jobs are running in jenkins but one of the jobs is running at every hour so I want to check the how many times that particular job has built successfully/failed in last 24 hours, along with time.
My problem is that a "system groovy script' executes only on the master node and 'Jenkins groovy scripts' run on slave nodes but have no access to the /code/ variable.
/pre/  Is there a way to modify the build variable on a "Jenkins Groovy Script" which runs on a slave?
You list mainly the advantages of having "Jenkins as Code".
The main reason is that Jenkins pipelines work really well with Docker.
How can I join strings nicely into a path when programming Jenkins Groovy pipeline?
But along with those commands i need to run the mvn command with different arguments.But somehow after execution the build gets stuck and kept running in Jenkins.
It looks like you are dealing with builds inside the Jenkins workspace in which case the /code/ could be the agent startup code and running threads could be the workers.
In your case, &lt;Jenkins url&gt;/job/&lt;Job_name&gt;/api/json?tree=allBuilds[result,number,url,timestamp] api will give you the details in json format from which you can calculate all the data you wanted like number of builds triggered, passed and/or failed in last 24 hours.
Use api &lt;Jenkins url&gt;/job/&lt;Job_name&gt;/api/xml?tree=allBuilds[result,number,url,timestamp] to get same data in xml format.
While using Jenkins, it seems to stop at 'node scripts/color-less.js', these are some logs.
This is also an issue with jenkins- defaults to the same Window size: (1044, 788) .
12-07 12:57:29.409 F/        (20795): * Assertion at /Users/builder/jenkins/workspace/xamarin-android-d15-9/xamarin-android/external/mono/mono/mini/unwind.c:640, condition `cfa_reg != -1' not met .
I am running a set of unit test cases using pytest through Jenkins.
After update to jenkins 2.138.3, the creating of  buildpipelineview fail when the dsl script running the second time.
/pre/     /code/ may need script approval when it gets used for the first time in Jenkins Pipeline.
I have a previously working Jenkins pipeline, where I am inserting an environment variable into a step using withEnv: .
How can I avoid Jenkins from wrapping long lines in the console output?
If I remove -p 50000:50000 from the command it can bind and start Jenkins but I assume it needs this port mapping to work correctly.
/pre/  Is there a way to get Jenkins to use a variable for the docker image specification?
However, this progress does n't match with Jenkins' estimate.
Are there any ways to pass utility 's estimate of the progress to the Jenkins so it could update progress bar accordingly?
Jenkins is smart enough to know that it 's running inside a docker container so when parts of job need to run in another container it correctly passes the volumes etc.
This sounds silly but I was wondering if it 's possible to make jenkins treat the main node as another slave node?
It 's because you are assigning Jenkins instance to variable inside pipeline.
However if you need to perform some operations on jenkins instance you can use /code/ annotation.
I 'm trying to write a java program which will provide the build status of a particular job, this Jenkins job is running at every hour and I want to get the build status(success or failed) of each build for the last 24 hours.
Jenkins in its turn has /url/ which can build performance trends charts for the following formats: .
I am trying to register JUnit tests results with Jenkins.
This is not the first time I do that, I have a handmade test framework made for Matlab, which generate a handmade Junit test report, feed it to Jenkins, and it works flawlessly.
My building machine is a jenkins slave, which run the building jobs in one time only, with --rm option, docker containers.
I have a requirement like I want to execute a script first on the Jenkins Server and the second script on the slave.
I need to pass the env variables set by Jenkins to the second script.
Also, Is it possible to send the env variables set in Jenkins Server during run time to the slave and set the same in the slave?
I must do dockerize with Jmeter - to run Jmeter tests in Jenkins.
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /your/home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins .
docker run --name Myjenkins -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v /home/Jenkins_vol:/var/jenkins_home Jenkins:latest .
flyweight executors are just threads, running inside of the Jenkins   master’s JVM.
Increase the numbers of executors for your Jenkins.
I have no idea why Jenkins wo n't run the post always step in case of a failing build.
Since the jenkins job triggers a powershell script, the script would be executed with the user with which jenkins process is running.
On a Windows 10 OS, I am running docker for Linux Container for running JenKins.
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v   jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts .
However there is this /url/ which runs groovy script after every build of every job on Jenkins.
I am trying to trigger a Jenkins downstream job if 80% of unit test cases pass.
The current Jenkins job runs a bunch of Test Cases triggered through Rest API in Dev Environment.
I 'm also unable to do so from inside jenkins job, because the job commands run inside the shell of the docker container, there is not way to talk to the parent(which is the jenkins host).
Script is executed by a job jenkins, allocated in a Jenkins Windows Server.
This is the behavior intended by the SECURITY-170, see Jenkins   Security Advisory 2016-05-11 .
Is there a way to perform /code/ in an automatic fashion (so that Jenkins can do it with just a script shell) and without hanging ec2?
We have a jenkins jobs that run autotests with parameters: .
I was using windows batch file to execute my automation scripts through Jenkins but now I have to move to Mac OS x.
In my case I have put the bash script within the source code, so the Jenkins pipeline simply executes it to create the new task definition and update the service.
My performance testing tool is JMeter and appserver is Jenkins .
Since I wanted to be able to run those TestNG xml 's on Jenkins using Maven I am trying first to run them manually in terminal using simply "mvn clean test" but that always run all TestNG test classes with names ending with *Test.
However, if two matching branches are pushed within the polling interval, will Jenkins build both of them?
Is there any way to pass parameters (like "order ID") from UFT build to Jenkins Console Output?
Assuming that your /code/ used for the multibranch pipelin triggers another job unconditionally of the branch Jenkins does it all as expected.
/pre/  The return in Jenkins is : .
Since you need to have environment variables that are shared across all Jenkins projects and jobs, you should set them up on Jenkins instance level rather than on a Jenkins project or job level.
Jenkins runs fine, it just does not output any of my print statements.
I am having build number of Jenkins job, Using that build Number I need to get Environment variables associated with the build using JAVA Program.
If you have multiple machines per environment you can set /code/ as a custom environment variable and use it inside a /code/ block as well (Manage Jenkins -> Manage Nodes -> Configure (on each node) -> Node Properties -> Tick Environment variables).
Headless JVM and fonts: For OpenJDK builds on minimalized-footprint   systems, there may be issues running the headless JVM, because Jenkins   needs some fonts to render certain pages.
A solution was proposed and integrated in jenkins.war since weekly   release 2.55 (and not yet in any LTS to date) which enables the   administrator to configure which function signatures should be used   for each function known to have different variants, apply it to their   application server initialization options and then run and update the   generic jenkins.war without further workarounds.
I am trying to configure Jenkins scheduler which should execute a job every 55 days.
I 'm running Jenkins 2.155 on an Ubuntu 16.04, using docker.
I have around 20 Jenkins JobDSL seed jobs which have been running without issue for a couple of years now.
Create a job in jenkins to call the script of approach #1 or execute docker commands of approach #2.
val3 and use it as a parameter to a Jenkins job.
Usually, the plugin execution happens on a build executor in a Jenkins slave.
You are trying to execute a Jenkins pipeline script as groovy postbuild action which will never work as the two have different syntax and usage (that is why you get the error that /code/ method is not found).
I actually want to pass the choice parameter as a /code/ like "$choiceParam" for /code/ so that I can just update the jenkins job configuration instead of always updating the values in the pipeline script .
Use a environment variable from operation system in jenkinsfile, so where jenkins is running this variable should be created.
I would like to define an array of strings within the environment tag/body of the Jenkins pipeline.
I 'm using the env variable "currentBuild.result" to modify the overall job status of a Jenkins job.
I 've run "du -h" in the jenkins script console and have looked at the directories containing both plugins but nothing jumps out as storing the test results, either in terms of naming convention or directory size... .
Under jenkins I am executing Job in the following way .
Just as a side note, my jenkins pipeline works as expected and polling works as expected as well, I just need to make this process automated.
I am trying to run a Jenkins DSL script to create jobs that build periodically with multiple parameters.
Automation output is directly consumed by Jenkins to report test results for the build/job as well as consumed by another Python script that pushes results back to Kiwi .
I am trying to calculate the average wait time across all builds on a Jenkins master.
I tried Jenkins pipeline unit-writing the unit test cases and mocking the jenkins global variables but discovered that it did not work in our case as we have a lot of jenkins shared libraries wrriten in groovy/boto3/aws cloudformation templates.
As far as "gothas" go, I think that it is still impossible to load one jenkins library from another.
It costs 10 min to publish our project in jenkins, ^_^.
I am stuck at how to properly use nested conditions as proposed in the Jenkins syntax.
I am using jenkins and having scripted syntax in jenkinsfile In the main job after source checkout I need to run other job /code/ times (parallel)  with different inputs .
Wanted to check if there is way to do static analysis of Hive SQL or Generic SQL code using Jenkins pipeline?
I assume i need a way to override the existing resolution using Jenkins parameter or adding some line of code to my testing project to support a case which resolution is different than 1920 x 1080. .
4) Did you encounter this recently, or has this bug always been there: We are executing our postman collections through newman in Jenkins for the first time.
This is one of the current tests in the jenkins file: .
When using /code/ step Jenkins evaluates the file.
/pre/  This returns an IP address of /code/ for the Jenkins container and /code/ for the SonarQube container.
I have a project in Jenkins in s2 that I would like to execute when build1 and build2 on s1 has finished with success.
I would like to ask if there would be a shortcut way to set the global environment variables generated by /code/ on one jenkins pipeline.
My aim is to have these generated values /code/ reusable to the 3 stage steps on one jenkins pipeline.
I am building a test system with Jenkins with multiple slave nodes.
I want to make the system in a way that when I start tests Jenkins running each test case in a node which is free and at the end collects and summarizes the test results.
I have opened a Jenkins job which is general test-case job and it is parametrized where the parameter is the "test name".
But I see that Jenkins is executing the jobs sequentially.
I want to replace some variables in a file having $variablename, at runtime from jenkins pipeline script.
/pre/  We also tried to use the jenkins jacoco plugin and merge the results there.
edit: in the time since, Jenkins X has evolved a lot.
Recently I have tried to build a jenkins pipeline with a large number of 'Tests' in one of its stages.
Hi you can use parallel stages in jenkins which runs parallely.
My project have 59 testcases i want to get the test report execution result to be created when Jenkins job is executed.
how do jenkins can run the IIB related run time commands and toolkit commands like mqsicreatebar in another server ?
Is there any other option to instruct Jenkins to execute the entire pipeline from inside a sub-directory?
1 other important thing to consider will be the case where you want to run these tests on jenkins slaves thus hardcoding the hostname will not work.
Currently I use Jenkins to execute windows batch commands.
I have a string variable in my Java application that is being built by Jenkins.
How can I get in Jenkins the value of the Java string variable?
I 'm running some jmeter tests on Jenkins, and for some reason it stops displaying the results of the last test run and freezes, only displaying results from a run that has been completed berofe, for example, if I start a new run, it will display the results from a previus one over and over again, no matter how many times I run the test suit... Is it any config that I need to change?
I can call another jenkins job using the /code/ command.
How does this Jenkins job make sure that these three steps are performing on the code sequentially.
This is because of the part with /code/ where that dollar sign is being interpreted as denoting a Groovy and/or Jenkins variable interpolated within a string.
If I have a Jenkins pipeline script (though the principle could apply to any Jenkins script really) that has different behaviours depending on which branch is getting built, how can I test that it 's working properly without merging it into that branch?
However, you can do outside of Apigee by running Jenkins job which calls your proxy every minute or creating a unix or batch script and run it as a corn job.
Call this API from Jenkins, with, for example, a curl (you can do it with Groovy if you want to), something like this (assuming you return a json response): .
backups of Jenkins itself), use the /url/ to limit which jobs can be executed there.
I am setting up a Jenkins Pipeline, which calls an external library with a compare XML function written in Groovy that utilises xmlunit.
/pre/  However when running the pipeline in Jenkins it returns a /code/.
I know that it is n't a global function in a Jenkins file, as per the question, but I think that it can be a viable solution to the problem in general.
I have a groovy script which can provide multiple choices for one of the parameters in my Jenkins-Parameterised-Build.
Now I am running a process in all the nodes through Jenkins.
However, my collection script has a few variables that need to be set that are dependent on the jenkins pipeline env.
The mechanism we 'd like to use is Jenkins, so what we need is a job that we can run every minute or so, and that job to fail if any volume is over 80%.
Does it have something to do with the fact that I run Jenkins from a Docker container?
When i try to print it from Jenkins using:  /code/ it prints the whole list as a single string and using /code/ prints "string".
In my Influx I have two (2) measurements called: jenkins_data and jenkins_custom_data.
/pre/  Note that build_successful is a field in jenkins_data and build_result is a tag in jenkins_data while branch is a field of jenkins_custom_data .
In this case, all you need to do is convince Jenkins to produce for you the tag name it passed to /code/.
Is it possible to expand the Jenkins Pipeline script Definition window?
We have a jenkins CE being used to run close to 4000 jobs.
/pre/  Note that /code/ is an environment variable injected by Jenkins dynamically.
I just want to be able to execute steps inside of the container, or alternatively - execute a command inside the container and then read the results of that operation back into Jenkins.
I have 3 stages(a,b,c) to run on jenkins using pipeline code(scripted), I  need to run stage a,b in parallel and run c after a is success (I am  doing this using pipeline code) but in blue ocean it showing only task  name but I wanna see stage names(in this case I have only 2 tasks with 3  stages and stage a and c are in one task).
You 'd need one Jenkins pipeline for every release branch and one for the primary development branch (if you 're not releasing directly from it).
/pre/  Currently, my Jenkins build times out after 5 minutes.
I just created two EC2 instances, one with Jenkins and one for the go application.
I tried to troublshoot by bumping the memory and java heap size with following argument in Jenkins pipeline code but that did not helped too.
I found online that maybe using parallel processing and changing the java version type to 64 bit -64 might solve the problem but was not able to configure it properly in my Jenkins pipeline since there was not much information available.
I have two machines in Jenkins, one master, and one slave, both of them are Windows 2012 R2.
We run the xcodebuild commands to build the workspace with a XCODE_CONFIGURATION_BUILD_DIR, so that multiple jenkins CI jobs wo n't overwrite the build output of other jobs which are also running concurrently.
/pre/  To call this method we need to pass the path of property file as a string variable For example, in our Jenkins file using groovy script we can call like  .
/pre/  To call this method we need to pass the path of property file as a string variable For example, in our Jenkins file using groovy script we can call like .
I have pipeline code to do all the above process, but i need help to pass the git commit id to script using the jenkins parameterized build.
I declared a variable in environment block in jenkins pipeline with default value='null' and trying to change the value in a stage.
I have a job in Jenkins that accepts a text file parameter.
Whenever I am trying to do execute shell command in freestyle job in Jenkins, however when I try to do same thing while from pipeline, it is running successful.
You 'll need to stop your current jenkins container to free up the ports.
/pre/  Next, let 's pass the SSL arguments into the jenkins container.
/code/ maps 8443 jenkins port in the container to the 443 port of the host .
You can go to environments variable and set path of pm2 into system path variable or you can change the user under which jenkins is running.
I have a total number of 50 Jenkins Jobs with SCM Polling for every hour and i wanted to change all at one time to 2 hours instead doing one by one his their any mechanism to update it in just one click with any groovy syntax.So, all the jobs will be scheduled for H/2 * * * *  .
I have hundreds of jenkins jobs(multibranch pipeline) with trigger enabled to periodically scan respective repositories every 5 mins.
In the below example, we are considering the slave machine to be a windows machine, hence the option of “Let Jenkins control this Windows slave as a Windows service” was chosen as the launch method.
I am currently working on to Automate Siebel compile through jenkins, As we all know for full compilation there is a command, however i am unable to do the same for Incremental compilation, most of the result says incremental compilation cannot be automated, is there any way?
specify a non local location of /code/ because I now need to run the scan on another VM/container instead of on the Jenkins container .
I am trying to start two processes from a Jenkins job using a Windows batch command: .
Jenkins slave is started from command prompt and I can see the process windows being shown for half a second.
Question: How to execute a windows batch command in Jenkins that is not killed?
However, I do not know what syntax I have to use to make Jenkins pipeline understand that the '(x86)' is part of the environment variable name.
/pre/  And the Jenkins file simply defines a map, and then call /code/ call.
We now have a need for another Jenkins job, where some of the stages will be the same.
/pre/  This way the /code/ will be executed within temporary Docker container created by Jenkins /url/ from /url/ image.
I am at situation where I cannot run a build of pipeline-style Jenkins job because the last Jenkinsfile had a typo, 'n' instead of  'm' in 'name':  .
C:\Users\svcBICM\AppData\Local\Temp\jenkins6041485005934862737.sh:   line 16: C:\Program: No such file or directory .
I have set up Jenkins mostly on Linux and a couple of times on Windows.
I am encountering an undesired behaviour: Jenkins appears to be expanding environment variables references within the parameter environment variables before my script has a chance to read them.
My initial test case was the following, using the Jenkins Job Builder Groovy DSL.
Is there any way to access the original parameter values for a Jenkins before they 're subject to variable expansion/interpolation, or to otherwise disable or circumvent this behaviour?
Such configuration was trivial with Jenkins freestyle job and Throttling plugin  - I simple used "Maximum Concurrent Builds Per Node".
It seems that Jenkins is designed to clean all running processes at soon as possible as per /url/ and /url/: .
To reliably kill processes spawned by a job during a build, Jenkins   contains a bit of native code to list up such processes and kill them.
While the aforementioned question mentions a few ways to overcome this, it is clear the recommended way is to not spawn long-running processing via a job step, but outside of Jenkins (e.g.
If i run the job manualy providing the arguments as jenkins string parameters it runs smooth, receiving the arguments fine.
I want to invoke tox with python versions 2.7 &amp; 3.6 in parallel in a jenkins pipeline.
/pre/  Kindly let me know whether there 's any way to use 'job parameter' or 'environment variable' in Jenkins .
Jenkins will start the test execution  .
It explains best practices in writing Jenkins pipeline code.
Jenkins can be used to build pipelines (sequences of tasks) or to be called from a pipeline (to execute one of the pipeline 's tasks).
However, Jenkins is generally not used to "code" and "operated" applications.
Jenkins powershell block does not wait until it is finishes it seems to go unto the next block which is a Windows Batch Command.
/pre/  So is there a way to tell Jenkins to wait for the powershell process to end and only then however long it takes to go and execute the next block?
But if I type the command in my terminal (outside Jenkins) without the simple quotes surrounding the path, It works.
Jenkins can stream over the console output from a Job running on a Node.
Given a Jenkins pipeline that runs a series of steps, some within /code/ blocks, is there any way to obtain within the pipeline the Flow id of a given step or the most recent step?
/pre/  After implement some tests and removing the nuget (but not as a direct result of removing it), the compiler on jenkins needs a main.
Am using Performance plugin to View the jmeter test result reports in Jenkins.How ever when i generate multiple test results files (*.jtl), Jenkins is showing only one Test Result Report.
I 'm using parametrized test ng method but in build results on Jenkins only test method name is displayed without any parameters so I do n't know exactly which test case failed.
I am looking to grab the result of a batch file that is executed within a Jenkins pipeline Groovy script.
Jenkins has to run 24/7 in company server so it triggers test scripts in one of company 's computer ?
/url/ this is close what I want but there I havent found a way to delimit this, and I tried with 1k process just doing an echo and my Jenkins started to struggle with this, almost going hanged.
/pre/  Also, there is another way to change your artifact version automatically - by specifying it as /code/ in your Jenkins pipeline and then pass it as a parameter to /code/ command.
Another possible Solution is the Usage of Jenkins Multibranch Pipelines - They do not react on branch deletion (except by removing the Workspace of the deleted branch) .
/pre/  Finally you can use a loop to consume this /health endpoint from your Jenkins pipeline.
We use Jenkins (2.150.1) together /url/ (0.14.0).
I 'm working on a Jenkins pipeline project to execute Jmeter and Robot scripts together win two stages of the node.
For example, if no one is logging in to a VM but Jenkins service is running on that VM then in that case you may want to not disturb that VM.
So, to validate if Jenkins service is running on a VM or not you may have to run a Kusto query something like this.
I want to know if there is any way that we can ignore or skip some requests while the results are passed on to the graph generation in Jenkins-pipeline?
I have Jenkins running on CentOS 7 server AWS EC2 instance, I want to implement TestNG suite with Jenkins, in my local Windows 10 machine it is working fine.
How do I access the current date as a macro in Jenkins?
How can i get this revision number data from jenkins, within my buildstep plugin?
But at Jenkins job, /code/ is used and the second test goes to the "Retries" section.
Issue: I have 2 Jenkins jobs and they both which calls another common/reusable downstream job (that uses a regex to pick its rpm).

I need to call Docker during Jenkins job executing to perform some base Docker operations: build, push, pull.
The example shows how to trigger jobs on all Jenkins nodes from Pipeline.
so it should be possible to trigger the same functions used when Jenkins interpret your pipeline created through the UI.
/pre/  Then I goto Manage Jenkins --> Configure System --> Cloud --> Kubernetes and increase "Max connections to Kubernetes API" by say.... 20 and re-run the job and it works.
Jenkins is notorious and task scheduler is inefficient.
Call that "task scheduler job" from Jenkins by: .
But when I am trying to run my docker-compose file to run jenkins and jenkins data volume containers (already pushed to ECR) I am getting "RESOURCE:MEMORY" error even though the CPU and memory utilisation is 0%.
/pre/  It seems like it 's not working because Jenkins is taking it as a whole string and not taking "${appname}" as a dynamic variable.
This command need to be inserted inside the Jenkins pipeline as a Groovy code: .
I have a .net project that I want to deploy to Lambda function using Jenkins.
The steps contain the procedure which one should install Jenkins also under Ubunto 18.04 with Java 8.
The command will show running processes, then grep for a process running as a daemon that includes the string 'jenkins'.
why it worked outside of jenkins but not inside is still a bit befuddling; however, the combination of those two actions resolved it for me.
I make my jenkins job to wait about 60 secs after starting the jar, then check apache access log whether its wwwcheck returns code 200 or not.
But then when I use it in jenkins job I have to run one command to run on both machines so would not work .
I tried to run robot file test case in jenkins.
How can i make jenkins wait to start the next job until the postbuild is finished.
The only problem is that I want to visualize multiple lines at the same time and the Jenkins scripts creating the CSV files for these are creating multiple separate files.
It appears as if Jenkins sends some data over at the end and that an RPC framework is doing sequential calls that are latency-bound.
Because, whenever I run my Jenkins job, I am able to fetch the values of /code/ and /code/ however it is not replacing ACC_KEY and SEC_KEY with those values.
Is there a way to say 'use that agent' and 'use its env variables from the main Jenkins Node configuration'?
I would like to have a PowerShell script which I would be triggering using a Jenkins job every 30 mins.
I use Terraform + Jenkins to create my lambda functions through s3 bucket.
The Target parameter will fail if multiple comma separated inputs (target1, target2) are provided in Jenkins.
How can I restrict the Jenkins pipeline to accept just one parameter (target) as parameter and not multiple comma separated values.
/pre/  You can invoke this api from Jenkins in many ways : simple shell execution,groovy and scripted/declarative, pipelines.
You can invoke this api from Jenkins in many ways : simple shell execution,groovy and scripted/declarative, pipelines.
This Python function gets the crumb, and additionally uses the crumb to post to a Jenkins endpoint.
I would like to make a call to an RESTful endpoint from a Jenkins pipeline using the contents of a file from my workspace as the body.
I am guessing, These many API calls would make the Jenkins server perform slow?
I want my jenkins build should break when code coverage does not meet defined threshold in karma.config.js.
My impression after two days of Buildbot evaluation is that we 'll stick with Jenkins, primarily due to it having /code/.
The solution was to add the following code prior to the scp call in the Jenkins pipeline: .
/pre/  Your Jenkins administrator may need to approve this script from /url/ the first time it 's loaded.
This behaviour does n't have to do with parameters specifically, but with how Jenkins handles environment variables in general.
LE Edit: Jenkins seems to start again to create huge log files: currently 50gb + and using much cpu / memory:   .
I am trying to to do ssh to a VM and getting list of files of a folder, storing result it in a variable in Jenkins execute shell .
I 'm considering the option to use Jenkins Pipeline to build data ETL pipelines.
I am trying to use Jenkins to do that for me by declaring a string parameter.
In my Jenkins pipeline I have a string parameter named /code/ with default /code/.
Calling Node js script in Jenkins pipeline script as follows: /code/ /code/ to be used later in the pipeline script .
In my Jenkins pipeline I have a string parameter named version with default LASTEST.
I am doing ping test to that site for every 5 min and built that as a jenkins job.
At the moment, I am researching if it is possible for Jenkins to actually perform this task though a Jenkins job.
For example if first jenkins job is running it will use /opt/abc/ci1.inventory file.
I have a ansible template where I have one variable "jenkins_ci_job" which I want to assign a value according to the jenkins job running.
For example if job 1 is running then it will assign the value "ci1" to "jenkins_ci_job" variable.
Often a simple setup will execute the jobs on the same machine it 's running Jenkins as well.
However when I attempt to execute the same in a Jenkins Build step either through inserting the command inside the build step or  invoking it via the absolute path, I get this as the outcome : .
I want to run a query on remote oracle database from jenkins.
I have the Jenkins pipeline job, in which I need to copy the required files from Linux slave to windows slave .
/pre/  Path Environment Variable for Windows Jenkins Node: .
/pre/  Speculation: With my current understanding, I 'm not sure how this the docker command is generated, but I believe my issue is the /code/ flag after the /code/ since the Jenkins node is a Windows and the Docker image is also Windows.
The behaviour that I 'm getting is that Jenkins is using the same executor to run all the stages.
/pre/  The idea is that the value of groupToRun is passed from a Jenkins job triggering this test suite.
First off, the /code/ block declares Jenkins-level key-value pairs: .
Jenkins level is not workspace level, variable interpolation level is selected depending on the type of quotes, so if I understood properly: .
I am trying to print a variable in Jenkins.
For such things Jenkins should have ready solutions so im feeling im doing something not the way it should be done.
How can I run a task from the command line for long-running jobs like reports from Jenkins in Spring Boot?
I want it to run automatically each week with cron or Jenkins.
I have a Jenkins job implemented as a groovy pipeline with some windows batch calls (NOT bash shell) in it.
The Jenkins console output is very verbose, so every line of the groovy script, even the curly braces "{" are being displayed... .
If not is there an alternative way to achieve context+namespace switch during Jenkins pipeline step?
I 'd like to load a closure for my Jenkins build, but pass it some variables that are generic to any type of build (Go, Java, Docker) that are going on on our system.
I need to read though this file and execute Jenkins pipeline steps in Loop.
I need to call the Jenkins_files_main in Jenkins_files.
While running TestCafe .js files (with 60-70 tests) using firefox headless mode browser through a Jenkins JOB, getting below error after 14 -15 test.
Fundamentally, a step tells Jenkins what to do at a   particular point in time (or "step" in the process).
In general, the Java process which starts Jenkins needs the argument, for example /code/ .
I have a Jenkins Job which passes variables/parameters to a powershell script.
i just set up jenkins on a windows 2016 server.
I want to convert below line to run as a bash script so that i can call it using jenkins job.
Basically, my end goal is to have a pure shell script and invoke that on jenkins job.
In Jenkins 2.138.3 there are two different types of pipelines.
In Jenkins 2.138.3 there are two different types of pipelines.
My goal is to pass an environment variable (or parameter) from one Jenkins Job to another.
It still writes the variable to the file but Jenkins will not "reinject" this variable back into the job 's env variable even though I am using the exact same step to do so.
/pre/  Both sucesffuly write the string to the props file, but when done with a powershell command, Jenkins will not absorb the txt from the run.
Note that if you need to authenticate, you need to substitute a /code/ or /code/ in the /code/ part of the command before /code/ and after the argument for the Jenkins URL.
I am trying out Jenkins pipeline for the first time and ca n't seem to figure out what is going wrong here.
In case you mean to identify the build number from within the Jenkins pipeline, then yes, it can be identified using the pipeline /url/ /code/.
I have a Jenkins job which takes 2 file parameters and a string.
In Jenkins, i need to limit running job execution for only one times per day It 's possible ?
1) There are two types of pipeline in jenkins.
When I start in a Docker environment with Jenkins a JMeter test using a jmeter-maven-plugin, then the HttpRequests will always fail with a 403.
I see that the variable /code/ returns the merged branch but it looks likes the Jenkins job not know this branch.
I assume it 's possible (not being a Jenkins operator myself) to "register" the Azure VM you have as a node in your Jenkins setup and declare a /url/ agent to run on that node to perform the deployment operations.
I have a jenkins pipeline where i am running sonarscan in one stage by running sonar-scanner command , I have a requirement of publishing test report in sonar at later stage of pipeline and there  do n't want to execute sonar scan again is it possible ?
such steps are available under sh/bat execution, you can deal with your make/makefile as usual , Jenkins will just execute it and give you back results, afterwards inside pipeline you will decide what to do with it, e.g.
In my Jenkins: "Invoke Nexus Policy Evaluation", I have set the stage as "build" and Application "3424202293245234341".
Finally after many different tweaking attempts, got a solution here: Eventhough the Jenkins Pipeline syntax generator is capable of generating Jenkins script, it may not be always helpful.
Jenkins Pipeline executes Groovy code using /url/ and it has some limitations compared to a plain Groovy language.
I am trying to write a Jenkins script, and I am having trouble resolving one command.
Wondering if there are any suggestions to work around the API quota of 5000 from GitHub, particularly around Jenkins usage.
Now what I'am trying to do is to execute batch command in Jenkins that produces my program installer every time my application is built using Jenkins.
/pre/  Now I have to manually start Jenkins process to make it happens every boot time.
/pre/  you will see Jenkins_plugins is variable and its value is coming from one variable.yml file.
We would like to avoid fetching the source code twice, most preferably from jenkins.
I know there are ways to replace variables using plugins like Envject but it replaces ENV variables defined in jenkins.
("cmd /c call C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\jenkins556482303577128680.bat") .
I have a little problem, as I know, the best practice for the number of jobs per master is 500, which I 'm way over it which makes my jobs not run on time (for example, jobs that suppose to run each minute are n't doing so after X time), a reboot for the jenkins master does resolve it but it happens again after X time.
The machine hosting jenkins is a ubuntu with chrome version 70.0.3538.110-0ubuntu0.16.04.1 .
Note: I am using Jenkins jenkins-2.142 in Windows 10. .
In my case when I run my container I bind a volume mount with the /code/ parameter, when I build the jenkins job, it generate the package and I move to the remote docker volume.
I have a Jenkins job with several parameters, each with default value, for example:  .
If not, remove them and make sure that 'with_items', lines up with 'jenkins_plugin') .
I 'm using to SonarQube to scan my python code in a Jenkins job.
/pre/  I have  python on my pc and a i am calling the script in Jenkins as a windows Bach command .
And then you just simply use that in gradle settings in some way (for example have an environment variable defined only on the jenkins slave).
In case for test purpose if you are testing with already created file then, add below command inside jenkins job under Build > Execute Shell .
This is what /url/ in order for Jenkins to pick up on these test results.
/pre/  And changing the $JENKINS_HOME variable (around line 23) to .
This is limit on the total number of Pods that Jenkins can create on /code/.
Jenkins makes sure every executor it spawns is utilized to the maximum.
If you want to override this behaviour and spawn an executor for each build in queue immediately without waiting, you can use these flags during Jenkins startup: .
I am using Windows 10 and the Jenkins Version is 2.150.1 .
My goal is to have Jenkins 2 execute alpha integration tests between an express js app and a postgres db.
I have some hazy idea that there may be some conflict between how shell scripts and bash scripts work, but I cannot quite grasp the nuance in how Jenkins is not able to execute a script that clearly exists.
For example, instead of having the credentials in the code, grab the value for those variables from Jenkins.
I try to set up a Job in Jenkins that executes a shell script on a remote host using ssh, and store parts of the output (a path to a file on said server) in an env variable for further use in other steps.
You need to open port 8080 for Jenkins traffic and port 1337 for the Node.js app.
Specify time in seconds up to which Jenkins should wait for the JNLP   agent to estabilish a connection.
/pre/  this /code/ is called in another shared library /code/ were I defined pipeline steps and Map variables I pass in Jenkins: .
/pre/  I want to call my libTwo in jenkins  and pass two String parameters as /code/: .
I am running this on Jenkins so ideally this should be in Groovy, however a shell script would work.
You can use isUnix() function available in jenkins for identifying the OS type.
to have 'jq' command-line JSON processor available in the node where you run the pipeline (i.e., in Jenkins master in this example) .
My jenkins console is full of similar run statements: .
Set an envvar for a stage to a pipeline expression value using trigger params if pipeline param is null (for triggered execution from jenkins) .
I am trying the retrieve the output/status of a variable available in bat to a jenkins pipeline by setting env variable initially as true.
I was trying to perform a /code/ copy from my jenkins workspace one job content to my docker containers (web2py) named volume location.
Requirement: I need the script to run after the build is completed in Jenkins.
Write the variable to a file in jenkins.
Now I need to run this in Jenkins which is running on docker container.
As Nahuel Fouilleul mentioned in his answer this is just one line and the script and yml files are other arguments and as I mentioned in the comment to Nahuel Fouilleul the problem is because of "[[" I ca n't source that script in shell environment of jenkins (even if the script has its own shebang) so I added the shebang to the shell block in jenkins as below and now it works.
Another time jenkins does not detect SpockTest class.
Is there a better way to move files into Jenkins?
/pre/  The code will write down the current number of threads in all /url/ into a file called /code/ in Jenkins Workspace and on subsequent runs it reads the value from it, adds 10 and writes it back.
Otherwise I need to pause the pipeline (freeing the Jenkins agent) until that time range is reached.
Still the bottom line is: Jenkins does not cache automagically for you.
i 'm new to jenkins and i 'm trying to run a job which runs on mulitple machines.
/pre/  However, when I log into the jenkins container it works from the command line: .
In my current system, I just call MSBuild from Jenkins with the appropriate parameters.
/pre/     Take note of the double quotes in the above statement, Jenkins will not convert the env variables if the quotes are not formatted properly or single quotes are added instead.
Note that this approach wo n't work on a Jenkins, since it does n't /url/.
Or maybe not as a Jenkins credential, but a way to mask out an arbitrary string that is from a command output.
Here are the last few lines of the output from the Jenkins console: .
Can someone tell me how to tell Jenkins that exit 1000 is success when using Windows Batch Execution?
I 'm looking for a way to tell the difference between two Jenkins jobs ("projects") /code/ and /code/ from within Jenkins - for example, using some Groovy code that 's running in the script console or as a build step.
The result of this would be to execute two different unitTest dlls with a different value of the property using the command line on Jenkins.
Here is my code to run things under the slave, based on the Jenkins VirtualChannel/Callable mechanism (simplified): .
ISSUE In Jenkins i will have to execute these commands as /code/ But i am not able to understand how do i dynamically pass the version number that was created by /code/ command in step 1, to /code/ command in step 2?
Jenkins sets $P4_TICKET environment variable.
been trying several trial and errors on where or how to cut the string in the variable and assign to a new variable to be used by jenkins stage.
As a part of the image, I perform git clone to fetch a repository from github that has multiple python scripts which corresponds to multiple stages in my jenkins pipeline.
When I run the container, I 'm able to see "jenkins_pipeline_scripts" directory which contains all the necessary python scripts for the pipeline stages.
Inside the Build step of a Jenkins job I am trying to echo the value of the /code/ variable.
Why Jenkins is running /code/ multiple times?
It would be helpful if someone explain step by step since i am naive to jenkins.
/pre/     Test result: Expecting List element get added to list before assertion   statement is run and expecting test to pass Actual , test pass in   local,  expecting test pass on Jenkins .
As a result of both options, the Jenkins job 's workspace folder will becomes your container 's /code/.
As I explained at begin, your job 's workspace will become container 's /code/, thus you can clone your code into jenkins job workspace via pipeline step, then you no need to /code/.
I use this statement /code/ to get device ID list, but it returns different list between Jenkins and terminal, so I ca n't start simulator via Jenkins.
All test cases are running in Jenkins docker container.
I know it could be easy if we trigger the local job from remote Jenkins once it completes the job in question but that is not an option .
I 'm using cucuable to run parallel cucumber-tests on jenkins.
The Jenkins dependencies will only be used if the property is true and the CI environment is detected through the presence of the /code/ environment variable.
Conan 1.8.2, Windows 10, Jenkins Artifactory Plugin 2.16.2 .
I 'm using jenkins to run my tests and do some cr on the code.
Today is the first time I am using Jenkins.
I am running Windows batch command on Jenkins to achieve the same: .
But after some time jenkins stops start build.
The test results are then aggregated using the Summary Report and this aggregated data is then used by Jenkins Performance plugin to display performance trends and notify developers about performance regressions.
Method 1: Running Jenkins On 80 Using IP Table Forwarding Rule .
/pre/  Now if you access Jenkins on port 80, IP table will automatically forward the requests to 8080. .
Best place to run tests is from jenkins as suggested by Bela.
In my project I have a Jenkins pipeline, which should execute two stages on a provided Docker image, and a third stage on the same machine but outside the container.
Now, we are in the process of migrating to Jenkins and using its Parallel Test Executor Plugin to parallelize the tests across multiple nodes instead of a single machine.
Jenkins data volume is going to be stored in a global storage that is shared between the two master containers.
I 'm trying to run a Python image in Jenkins to perform a series of unit tests with pytest, but I 'm getting some strange behavior with Docker.
Why does Jenkins say I am not running inside a container, when it has clearly created a container for me?
 I have a Jenkins process running with about 15GB memory allocated on a system with around 60 GB RAM.
The GC process kicks in to free memory and naturally slows down the Jenkins responsiveness.
I need to fetch a filename from a remote machine to use as a variable in a build on Jenkins.
I am using Jenkins version 2.165 and I am having problems with CPU utilisation of Jenkins on my EC2 instance on AWS.
/pre/  Using the /code/ directly works just fine (locally and on Jenkins), but using the /code/ only executes the first line of the closure (body).
The /url/ defines the /code/ location as a docker volume, so as long as your Jenkins jobs are making their disk operations within that location you should be fine.
In the case the JVM on which the Jenkins process runs on is too limited in memory, the Java garbage collector will runs too frequently.
I am running a declarative pipeline in which I am capturing the result for each Jenkins stage, but when the one stage returns unstable all other stages result also changed to unstable (Yellow).
Whilst I appreciate this is a matter of opinion somewhat, I am wondering what the reason is for the recommendation of separation, and whether I might be able to run Jenkins on the MacBook for now?
I have a Cucumber test suite which is executed by Jenkins on a pool of servers that at times is run concurrently across the server pool.
We use pabot for parallel execution with jenkins.
The runbook that you would write could be either in /url/ or /url/ and its purpose would be to just call the Jenkins API to start the job.
Jenkins parameter is not printed as expected using a pipeline script.
I am defining a variable in Jenkins pipeline script as: USER = "xx-yy-${Target}-zzz"  Here ${Target} is from a Jenkins comma separated parameters (server1,server2).
I am creating a multi configuration Matrix job to run my tests on multiple emulators on Jenkins but it is failing and emulator does not start.
I am finding that the last commit, last jenkins build is possible, but I need more.
But I could not assign a value into a variable in Shell script of Jenkins.
why cant i save value to variable in Jenkins shell?
In there, I declared a step which invokes the powerhell pipeline plugin and I am trying to use the jenkins environment variables as well as a build parameter with no success.
I am looking for a clean approach - perhaps convincing Jenkins to use a different home directory for each executor, so that I do n't have to run extra code in each job, but I have n't figured out how to do that yet.
Also I need to run this in Pipeline, so I need to pass these parameters from Jenkins.
Before running the code, Jenkins will do an AST transformation called "CPS transformation".
If you have empty global environment variables in your Jenkins configuration, it appears that you 'll get a malformed /code/ command since Jenkins will write the command, with your empty string environment variable, as /code/ .
You need to check your Jenkins global configuration and make sure you do n't have any empty environment variables accidentally defined: .
 In order to embed Jenkins expressions or variables (e.g., /code/) , you must /code/-quote (double-quote) your script; /code/ (single-quoting) encloses literal strings.
We want to create a jenkins pipeline job, which triggers several other jobs and then merges the results of the triggered builds.
However, when I change the label to my second cluster, that does n't have any Jenkins there seems to never want to build there and always builds on the cluster that 's local to Jenkins.
/pre/  A push to branch /code/ triggered the Jenkins job, however the Build steps are executed on branch /code/.
Coming to the big picture, I want to call this executable (entry points) in the jenkins pipeline.
I want to run test cases depending on variables passed from jenkins, like if i select TestCaseForHistoryPage in choice from jenkins, it should only run.
There is actually one line of script that you should run within jenkins and will fix the issue.
Though I am yet curious to know why I can not invoke multiple maven commands from with in jenkins.
In my jenkins pipeline I need a step to be executed only when /code/ can actually print something.
Things like one has Java on it the other does n't but but that is all around Jenkins.
Environ: OSX 10.14.3 (Mojave) Appcelerator:  build: 5.1.1.201809051655 Build: jenkins-appcelerator-studio-titanium_studio-master-38 (master) Date: 201809051655 .
This takes more effort and is more error prone/difficult, since Jenkins uses CPS (Continuous Passing Style) for Groovy Scripts.
We have x86 Jenkins running on Windows Server 2016.
I was only able to get this to work by starting Jenkins in the /code/ portion, but needed to start Jenkins before Flask since Flask would continuously run and the next command would never execute: .
jenkins_master: &nbsp;image: jenkins_master &nbsp;cpu_shares: 100 &nbsp;mem_limit: 2000M &nbsp;ports: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "8080:8080" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "50000:50000" &nbsp;volumes_from: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- jenkins_dv  jenkins_dv: &nbsp;image: jenkins_dv &nbsp;cpu_shares: 100 &nbsp;mem_limit: 500M     15.
/pre/  In Jenkins you can create job with "build with parameters" option and create a string parameter.Now you can pass this parameter in Jenkins.
I think the 404 is returned by your Jenkins.
Jenkins is not running because the /code/ is the main entry point for your container so only flask should be running.
You 'd probabaly have to reformat those results to plug into Jenkins but that 's probably pretty minor string hacking.
So jenkins currently keeps record of last 20 builds.
say if jenkins currently have records for builds 31 to 50, can i get build status for build number 20, 21 or so.
where /code/ is Jenkins build number .
I need to load parameters choice from a file (Ansible inventory file) in Jenkins.
Previous shell script (in the jenkins job) was something like: .
I have a bash script (executed by Jenkins) which calls at one point  .
/pre/   which in turn aborts the bash script and thus the Jenkins job.
At the moment there is no support to get the variables other than env vars in Jenkins.
Also we use Jenkins in the organization for execution of batch files remotely.
For learning the basic configuration steps one machine is totally enough and you can even run your builds with your Jenkins instance.
This works fine on the shell but when I put the command in a jenkins pipeline it does n't return anything.
How can we limit Jenkins users to archive a large amount of files/large files in their jobs?
please suggest the lines of code, such that the same need to be run by taking proper directories even if i run over cloud (Jenkins).
But the same is executed in Jenkins, it says "Creating test database for alias  'default'..." then start executing the tests.
/pre/  I use JDK8 and jenkins 2.164.1 on Ubuntu 16.04.6 .
Perhaps jenkins is just terminating the parent bash.
Or perhaps both bash &amp; python are in the same process group and jenkins signals the process group.
What is the best strategy to be followed to move the jenkins data from version 3.6 to Openshift cluster 3.11 .
Is there a way do determine the order or make jenkins to wait for the subjobs in postbuild?
we tweaked our jenkins job, it would now execute a sql script on the node ledger and update/code/ with appropriate values that were needed after the bootstrapping was done.
Jenkins sets environment variables for a running job to give you the job name and number.
If I use "Auto-Convert Freestyle Jobs to Jenkins Pipeline" plugin to convert these jobs into one pipeline job, what happens to the individual jobs(A to E) ?
When Jenkins is triggered, results from python script is stored in pickle files for the future use.
Tasks on Jenkins could be two.
I want to include code coverage in my Jenkins pipeline.
Jenkins will stop any build when a tool returns a non-zero exit code.
Under this, Environment Variable should list your JENKINS_HOME.
How to use environment variable in "List Subversion tags (and more)" parameter in Jenkins?
/pre/  The problem is that Jenkins only invoking the first script - /code/ - and the second script /code/ does n't run.
Below piece of code is part of my build script &amp; I 'm running it from Jenkins as a parameterized build option(node).
As I am writing the code in Groovy Script for a parameter in a Jenkins job, I am not getting much help in terms of errors.
How to list previous 24 hours job in Jenkins with the help of (Shell Script)?
I want to pass in jenkins parameters as array args to my bash script.
The usual way to avoid this problem is to be sure that the work-tree is up to date before starting any operations, whether those are Jenkins jobs, stages within a single Jenkins job, or just anything you intend to run yourself.
If you want to have a Jenkins job run particular Git commands, that job probably needs to have its own private work-tree.
/pre/  I also have a pool of persistent volumes in the jenkins namespace each labelled /code/.
/pre/  And in Jenkins I created two Jobs, one for each profile, and in each Job the following maven command is executed respectively: .
When I predefine the library in Jenkins before hand and call it using /code/ it works fine.
It also blocks the person using it from running jenkins jobs as the executor is busy.
Basically I want to run multiple cucumber tags on multiple jenkins jobs at the same time.
this code is deployed to a Win 10 box with Jenkins (NO SLAVES).
I used the "JENKINS PIPELINE" project and write the below code in jenkinsfile but the env.BRANCH_NAME is always returning the null value.
/pre/  Usually this is done by Jenkins.
I would prefer to use the /url/ functions of the Jenkins Pipelines instead of the groovy classes.
(thread safety/jenkins pipeline native, etc) .
/code/ returns /code/ allowing the Name variable to be accessible in the Execute Script action of Jenkins.
When running unit tests on my build my local machine takes approx 56 secs, but running the tests on our Jenkins build machine takes approx 4 mins 15.04 secs.
This is Jenkins thing I think.
I have a jenkins job, which I want to execute every 2 hours at random minute in range from n to m. .
/pre/  Or there is a function in jenkins /url/ which can be used.
I am trying to run PM2 using Jenkins Execute Shell as a last step of the build: .
What 's missing there in order to execute /code/ as a last step in the Jenkins build?
I have a Jenkinsfile (multi-branch pipeline) that 's supposed to run every time somebody commits something to any branch in Jenkins.
I work in windows7 os and using  wampp to run jenkins in /url/ and Waht i have done until now is trigger from a github repository and detect every one minute if there is a commithas been done to it and that 's all.
Probably jenkins has set the /code/ variable; so then you could run: .
/pre/  BTW: I know that this address array makes no sense in Jenkins but as I told, it is just an example how it is in my code!!
We have a Jenkins master-node but it is frequently hanging when it gets to 1.2 GB of memory usage.
I currently have a jenkins scripted pipeline job that is trying to run a /url/ instruction with 25 branches and this is hitting a soft limit (Container Cap/Max number of instances) configured in our Kubernetes Jenkins slave cloud.
The browser is currently determined by the value of my 'Browser' variable in the global properties in Jenkins.
Is there a way to assign the value from my PowerShell script to the 'Browser' global property value in Jenkins?
Next, if this is DB2 on z/OS, and you need to deploy it to a z/OS, its going to be difficult to do it through just Jenkins.
Jenkins will run on z/OS, but you need the Rocket software additions to get it running.
Random: The JNLP port is chosen random to avoid collisions on the Jenkins master.
Is there any way I can get the test to complete successfully without having to add the ACCOUNT_ID variable to Jenkins' env vars?

I 'm trying to pass groovy variable to powershell script inside of jenkins pipeline, all in the same place but i do n't know how.
What is the right way to run Jenkins in a windows container on Windows Server 2016 1607.
Therefor when you execute /code/ inside container, it will print the files &amp; fodler under your jenkins job workspace.
Anyway, this Jenkins job can be run 'Nightly, and then would use a seven day date range, or it can be supplied with a date range.
So,how do I change the environmental variable in the groovy step, and pass it back to Jenkins, so that the windows batch step gets the new values?
DevOps has requested that we limit our frontend builds to ~1GB of RAM, so that our Jenkins instance does n't shut down.
/pre/  ABC is my parameter which is defined in Jenkins' project as String parameter with default value xyz.
The full list of environment variables accessible from within Jenkins Pipeline is documented at localhost:8080/pipeline-syntax/globals#env, assuming a Jenkins master is running on localhost:8080 .
That plugin technically requires Jenkins 2.121.1 or later, but I recommend you upgrade to Jenkins 2.166 (Latest, stable at the time of this post).
The only way I found to trigger a Jenkins job by passing node as parameter is by installing node and label parameter plugin.
Jenkins: set environment value from script block possibly without using intermediate files.
in Jenkins declarative pipeline, is there a way to set a global environment var of a stage based on the output of the previous stage?
when I run simple selenium script on Jenkins it runs easily.
I want to tell Jenkins which test to run e.g "@MTC-016432" .
I am trying to pass variable assigned in previous stages to next stage of jenkins pipeline.
I am trying to setup various Jenkins pipelines whose last stage is always to run some acceptance tests.
It means jenkins already running on given port or some other process is using that port.
Kill process if jenkin allready running on that port or if other process is using that port you can run jenkins on other port.
I always get an 403 response (I run the script from windows cmd and inside jenkins with the script console).
I have a script using os.environ.get() to get variable from command line something like JENKINS_HOST="xx" JENKINS_AUTH="xx" JENKINS_TOKEN="xx" python script.py .
Sometime, when 4 build job are running, the CPU load almost 90%, I guess that is a reason why Jenkins dies.
I 'm running Jenkins version 2.150.1 in Ubuntu 16.04.
Refer the below to run shell and capture the output to a variable inside a Jenkins groovy file:- .
correspond to the values of the Jenkins task choice parameter Target .
This way I will be able to have a single target section that accepts the target name from Jenkins instead of 10-15 with hardcoded target names.
The reason why Jenkins (and in fact many other Java apps) favors 8080 is it is permitted to be used without any extra priviledges that are required for &lt;1024 ports.
I have a script which runs a subprocess and captures the output, but it only works if I run it in an interactive shell, but not if run from Jenkins.
This question seems to have been asked multiple times, but all the answers are irelevant for Jenkins Pipeline jobs (plugin: /url/).
There is another /url/ which is probably used within Jenkinsfile by calling /code/ inside a /code/, but I did n't figure out how to utilise it from the outside of Jenkinsfile (like from my groovy script ran Jenkins script console).
The withRegistry needs the registry as first parameter and the credentialsID (for jenkins credentials) as second argument.
Is there a way to make Jenkins evaluate PHP (or other script) files?
I want to access Jenkins outside the VM (Ubuntu 18.04) from my host (Windows 10).
I would like to pass the variable value from Execute Shell console to the Environment variables under  Global properties in Jenkins.
I tell jenkins to reuseNode, so any other stage using the same image, will be executing on the same container (it is just to speed up the provisioning time) .
This would be OK using a normal pipeline since it would just be a one off on creation of the Jenkins job.
The second possible solution is as follows: when a PR is created in github, the Generic Webhook will cause a new job to be created in the multibranch pipeline corresponding to that PR; the first time the multibranch pipeline runs the first build of this newly created job will fail for the reason given in the quote above; but then a solution might involve testing that the first job failed and somehow telling Jenkins to try rebuilding for that job again.
I have Selenium Grid 3.12.0 running on Jenkins with one node.
If you do not want the port number to be part of the URL, then you must ensure Jenkins listens on the default port (ie, 80 for http).
Another option is setting up a reverse proxy (listening on port 80) which forwards requests to Jenkins.
For example, if a project requires python but the EC2 image does n't have python, Jenkins will spin up a node, fail to run the job, spin up another node, fail to run the job, spin up another node... .
There is an option to limit the total number of nodes provisioned, but since each node is terminated after it 's deemed unsuitable, Jenkins only considers there to be one active node.
I.e., the number of nodes oscillates between 0 and 1, as Jenkins creates a node, discards it, and then creates another.
Use Jenkins to trigger shell script create dataproc spark cluster (In you case is /url/)  .
I am hoping to use a Groovy script that generates a list of jobs on a Jenkins instance as a build parameter.
The script works in Jenkins' Script Console: /url/ but does not work in the job: /url/ I get the same result if I /code/ any of /code/, /code/, /code/, or /code/ into the script, as referenced in the Script Console.
Linux version 4.15.0 (jenkins@jenkins) (gcc version 7.3.0 (Buildroot 2018.05)) #1 SMP Fri Feb 15 19:27:06 UTC 2019 .
I know that under the "Scan Multibranch Pipeline Triggers" option you can set how often Jenkins will look for changes, but I would prefer it to be the other way around, meaning that once new code is in the branch then Jenkins will build the pipeline.
I have Jenkins pipeline /url/, that specifies a global variable /code/ which provides two methods.
Perhaps, customizing the Jenkins code is an option, since it says it already runs in a Jetty servlet?
As Jenkins uses cron expression, there is n't a way to run a script every 61 minutes.
I have a python program running on Jenkins and I want the progress shown on one line.

Then, ideally, you have: /url/>NGINX listening on port 80 -> Jenkins on 127.0.0.1:8080.
I think the code runs in the background on jenkins.
So, if I use, say, 20 containers and each container suffixed "debug" exposes VNC on port 5900, how can I access a specific container I want that I assume is identified within an output of a Jenkins job, which sends a selenium test script to one of the nodes on the grid?

Is it possible to use the throttle-concurrent-builds-plugin in a jenkins pipeline job in a way that the job itself is limited to 2 builds per node and the parallel tasks in the testphase are not?
Some methods are not processed well under CPS in Jenkins with custom closures.
This object generates an issue inside the Jenkins pipeline because the pipeline uses Groovy CPS library for continuous-passing style transformation.
I have a small example of a Jenkins declarative pipeline that should run on both 'Windows' and 'Linux' agents in parallel.
Tests should run on Jenkins Slave nodes which again are run inside docker containers.
I 'm adding a checkbox to my Jenkins jobs in order to speed up a procedure.
I can already get all this data from the above REST API call, but I do not want to use that because, using that if I want to get the updated data in my database, I will have to poll the Jenkins REST API multiple times, (like maybe every 15 minutes or more frequently) which will increase the load on my Jenkins server.
I know that I can set up a Jenkins job to either call a script or call another downstream job through which I can then call a /code/ /code/ request to my end point.
But if I take the apk from jenkins size of the apk is 66 MB.
I have a simple python script I am trying to run in Jenkins.
This can be a serious problem that taints my testing environment if I do not have the exact same environment every time that jenkins runs it.
This is less secure but works well (if you define and MASK the password variables in Jenkins and call your script).
After job build starts in jenkins my git-lab server 's memory becomes full.
Say my target should have v1 and v2 the identical value, the step should be skipped, but both variables do n't have the identical value, jenkins should cancel the job.
Unfortunately, jenkins overrides this step even if both variable ones have different values.
I have created the jenkins freestyle project to run the katalon test suite collection from windows cmd, the run request for the test suite collection sent successfully to the katalon, but the process does n't complete and collection not run... .

Need to trigger a jenkins job using cli with node as argument  This can be accomplished using node and label parameter plugin using which we can pass nodename as a value to a defined parameter through cli.
As far as I understand, when an event trigger a jenkins build, the first thing it does is opening the jenkinsfile.
The ini file might for example remove in the stage Compilation the step Building Plan C by removing the groovy code doing that in the jenkins file .

While the library jenkins-shared-utilities seems to be available to Alfaclient, somehow, in the global vars bitbucketUtilities.groovy, the variable 'bitbucketUtilities' (@Field final BitbucketBuildOperationsHandler bitbucketUtilities) is n't identified.
jenkins in k8s configration finished, refer to /url/ but the pod can not start up correct。 /url/, /url/, and job config: /url/ /url/ result: job pennding for a long time /url/   .
Jobs can be scheduled at regular intervals in Jenkins just like with cron, in fact it uses the same syntax.
What 's nice about scheduling the job via Jenkins, is that it 's very easy to have it send an email if the job exits with a non-zero return code.
So by running it via Jenkins you 're covering the execution side and the monitoring side at the same time.
I have two streams in Perforce, Dev stream (parent) and Test stream (Child), Is it possible to merge changes from one stream to another using Jenkins job?
We have confirmed issues with take screenshot when Chrome 73.0.3686.75 is started by a service (such as Jenkins or Task scheduler) on Windows.

/pre/   /pre/   Note:When I open the terminal and run brew services start jenkins-lts jenkins go up using the new Port:8383 in these case they do not run any job, but when I run on the terminal the command: jenkins-lts the application up in the Port:8080 and here I can run all the Jobs without troubles.
This proxy essentially just takes all the request data, headers, and method, then passes it through to jenkins using the Python /code/ library.
The /code/ branch is used in a second Jenkins workflow which for now does the same as our first one: It builds the code from this branch and runs the tests against it.
Edit: If I remove the branch parameter and replace it with a simple string paramater for branch, it fetches successfully so it seems like a bug with the git parameter plugin - maybe when using cygwin/ssh with Windows Jenkins slaves.
Works for me with Jenkins 2.150.1 .
My requirement is to calculate "total number of builds" from the Jenkins box.
/pre/  I 'm using Jenkins 2.150.3, Angular CLI 7.3.4, NodeJS 10.15.1 in Windows 10.
I have a Jenkins job with a branch parameter, set to poll SCM every 5 minutes, and run a pipeline script from SCM: .
Here example how to get Job, build by number for the Job and all related to time using Groovy in Jenkins console: .
I trying to define powershell variable inside jenkins pipeline with the WORKSPACE variable in value.
Perhaps there is a way to "namespace" each Jenkins Job container such that none of their resources can be shared?
In our case, we wrapped the /code/ in a nice /code/ script to make it build nicely and to be nicely callable from Jenkins.
You can add a Bamboo task in your job to run a shell script that actually consumes the Jenkins API in that case you might need curl to be installed (in case of using a python script you can use requests, etc)  .
Example: To just run a Jenkins job that does not requires any params: .
/pre/  Example: To run a Jenkins job that requires params: .
In regards looking for the code base in Jenkins, I wo n't count with that option too much,  aside of  being way more complicated in comparison with the git repo inspection, it depends mainly of the job configuration setup: .
We have stage/prod emr clusters and we may need to run /code/ command on both clusters via the jenkins jobs.
How do I convert a parameter string to uppercase and use it in my Jenkins file ?
@Lazy does not appear to be returning the value on first call within a Jenkins pipeline.
I am using the AWS CLI on a Jenkins server, and one of the argument flags requires a JSON body.
I 'm trying to set the environment PATH variable in a Jenkins Declarative Pipeline and am trying to use the same in a bat block on a windows machine.
This is a problem, as our Jenkins VM has limited disk space.
I have Jenkins Groovy Pipeline where I am zipping a large directory (around 200 MB).
My Jenkins instance has just one job running (this one) and Jenkins machine has enough memory, so, RAM should n't be an issue.
/pre/  In Jenkins, you can create job with "build with parameters" and create a string parameter.
So I was playing with Jenkins, and I managed to run Jenkins jobs on Windows 10 even though they were failing.
So the way I did it I created a batch file to execute a set of tns commands, however, when I try to do it on macOS with the same logic only with bash script Jenkins is not able to pick up {NS} package.
i have also tried to run the jenkins using java -jar jenkins.war on command line  but i dont know the complete procedure.
I have this jenkins pipe line which has multiple stages.
Policy used to run jenkins task: .
I had jenkins and selenium grid + selenium node-chrome in one vps and everything was fine.
I have a jenkins Pipeline where there is a stage whose function is to call a Excel Work book.
You 'll need a branching strategy, perhaps some kind of 'run everything in this folder' script, and ideally some tools such as Team City or Jenkins to automate as much as possible, though I do n't think there is as much out there ready-made for PL/SQL as there is for more mainstream languages such as Java.
If polling every minute, in scenario #1, Jenkins will start two separate jobs, one for commits 1, 2, and 3, and a second for commits 4 and 5. .
Will jenkins create 2 separate build jobs in the queue if the polling frequency for SCM change is 1 minute?
From looking around it looks like this is because the command does not return a completion signal?, so Jenkins is waiting indefinitely.
Second part of the solution is for, when user would like to run a list of commands from a python script file from the same post build step window in that case user has to make sure to put all the required python files which you want to execute into the Jenkins workspace->project directory(project for which we are running the Jenkins ) .
I 'm trying to set-up a Jenkins pipeline with Jenkinsfile which calling methods from a self-implemented global shared library with the /code/ at the head of the Jenkinsfile.
In my Jenkins server I changed the "Concurrency Limit" field to 20, I ran 20 jobs expecting for 20 executors to be created and used for my jobs at the same time but only 8 were created and used.
I must send email with (total reporting 20 job) from Jenkins, But how to make Report total?
I will have to use either sh scripts, or the jenkins stash function but it does not seem like I can have a cross plateform code here.
1)How can we access Jenkins file parameter in our java code 2)What we have to send in Goal to initialise file parameter 3)Is it possible we should not select file via file tab at the time of build with parameter?
/pre/  but jenkins console print the string /code/ not the value of branch name.
/pre/  /code/ is Jenkins workspace, and if this workspace is /code/ and the sources are /code/ then the join function will return: .
but when you are executing manually, at that time jenkins added to docker group.
I 'm trying to build a Jenkins dashboard which should show 1)monthly build stats 2)list of jobs and console outputs 3)in future we are gonna run some queries too.
So what I want to do is just to run "rospack list" in jenkins job.

I believe I have pretty much up-to-date Jenkins and all the plugins and OS, but briefly: OS: Ubuntu Trusty 14.04.6 LTS Jenkins: Jenkins ver.
I want to run a python script Jenkins, in the form of a parameterized job, so that it takes input, and shows the output.
i changed the port number from 8080 to 8085 from the "jenkins.xml"     (C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins)  .
I have a small simple setup consisting of Jenkins &amp; Ansible 2.7.8 running on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (192.168.0.202): .
I would like to have a environment variable COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME with the value denpal-4 for a Jenkins job with build_id 4. .
I assume you tried the curl commands form inside the jenkins container.
Because Jenkins puts it into table each row was taking space even if it was empty.
/pre/  I saw too the findstr r/ option but i need the program catch this string literally (the jenkins_log is a file with too many lines (over 10000).

I want to run the same job (say job 'A') in parallel in all the machines in Jenkins (master and all the slaves).
I want to stop some of my jenkins jobs not to run in parallel.
But, I have some 100 jenkins jobs in which i want to add below lines in bulk, how can i do it using groovy script ?
I am trying to run power kvm in jenkins to power cycle some hosts.
Split up the maven lifecycles to as much pipeline stages as possible - which will result in better jenkins user feedback (see which stage fails etc.)
Let maven do everything and use the jenkins pipeline only to work with the results of maven (i.e.
So I need to make set of Jenkins jobs which runs one by one as per dependency tree: .
Since Jenkins is a JAVA application, we could use the common -Xmx -Xms -XX:MaxPermSize parameters to configure the RAM usage of this java process.
Change the memory at docker level could throw Out of Memory exception beacause Jenkins has a pre-configured memory limits.
Change Jenkins memory usage or limits .
Because in Jenkins,  /code/ is the first step for the job.
It`s of course valid in context of your local machine, but not when you are trying to use it to reach Kubernetes cluster from inside of node/agent jenkins container.
I have passed /code/ as string parameter in jenkins build.
Yes - this is a bug with Jenkins (we need a null-check in that bunkerkey function for sure).
I could just separate the script run from the terraform component, using a Jenkins pipeline to run the script in a separate stage, however I really would like a smoother integration than this.
/pre/  This is because Jenkins performs a /url/ command, which results in three problems.
I run the code below and My Jenkins Job never finishes.
   but in Jenkins, it does n't work because SCM is the first step for the job.
I am trying to run python test cases through Jenkins, it has the git clone command with ssh key.
In my case it is generating the index.html file as the test execution in Jenkins.
/url/I used the expression "*/40 * * * *" to run jenkins job for every 40 minutes.
I have a Jenkins pipeline which is scheduled to trigger every 4 hours.
This is in Jenkins pipeline using Groovy Syntax, so the only way to read variable 's value is with multiline double quoted sh.
/pre/  However I am managing to get the abc1234 as branch name when the git branch is /code/ But the above code fails the Jenkins job when it gets "develop" branch as the grep returns exit code 1 and then it does n't reach next if statement.
I am looking for the solution where I need to set-up the Jenkins Environment to run critical Jobs where it should have below mentioned properties in case of any failure ,   .
/pre/  i have allocated more memory to JVM (-Xms8g -Xmx8g), but both artifactory and jenkins consuming only 3GB memory only (refer from screen shot used memory).
Even though the memory requirements are generally low for Jenkins, having at least a 2GB host memory seems reasonable for a very basic server.

Able to successfully scale jenkins slaves using kubernetes on a Dev Machine(Spec: CentoOS 7, 12 cpu/core, 16G).
In Execute Windows Batch command option of Jenkins i have given below command .
Jenkins builds from penult (before last one) commit not the head.
The lambda is triggered whenever Jenkins destroys an instance, and from that event the lambda calculates how long the instance was alive.
If it was n't long enough (less than the idle period the node normally waits for), then Jenkins must be hanging and the lambda kills the job.
After if cpu usage down, try update to last tls version of jenkins.
The recommended heap size for Jenkins is a minimum of 200MB.
We currently see the test results in a nice graph in Jenkins.
We would like to have Jenkins show a graph per machine, or, be able to create a job per machine, that can trigger this job with parameters (and then save the build + test results not inside this generic job, but inside the per-machine-job).
I want to see Exact Line number in script in Jenkins console.
After long time I finally got the solution for my case to get local git name (for SonarQube) without "origin/" in my Jenkins freestyle project (not Jenkinsfile).
However, the Jenkins job will still run even if it is not expecting the parameter /code/.
We have confirmed issues with take screenshot when Chrome 73.0.3686.75 is started by a service (such as Jenkins or Task scheduler) on Windows.
I 'm trying to run some end-to-end tests in parallel and on DIFFERENT kubernetes pods on a declarative jenkins pipeline, jenkins however seems to attempt running the parallel stages on the SAME kubernetes pod.
/pre/  EXPECTATION: I would like for jenkins to spin up two different pods for each of the parallel stages.
ACTUAL RESULT: Jenkins runs both stages concurrently on the same pod.
[FIXED JENKINS-41316] Switch 'inside' back to CMD, detect if entrypoint was badly designed #116 /url/ .
Inside a jenkins stage and steps, I am trying to build an image; run the container with a volume and then stash a file in order to unstash it after.
My ultimate outcome is to reset the cluster environment each time when I executing the Jenkins jobs for each new release of our application.
Can anyone please let me know the approach to execute a script only for the first time when a branch is created and for the later builds it should execute a different script in Jenkins using Scripted Pipeline.
We have confirmed issues with take screenshot when Chrome 73.0.3686.75 is started by a service (such as Jenkins or Task scheduler) on Windows.
Already the jenkins job are predefined with set of some environment variables.
In other cases, Jenkins is run with user /code/, uid = 1000 .
Also jenkins has suggested few gc settings.
I am executing a test case from Jenkins.
For example http::9200. in general you could access the logs of the Jenkins in Elastic search under port 9200. .
/pre/  The only working solution so far is to not run Jenkins as a Windows service &amp; instead run in from command prompt but I want to use it as a Windows service because that has the benefit of not seeing the Java window running or keeping it minimized all the time.
What is the maximum string length which can be passed as a variable in a parameterized  job in Jenkins in a single variable.
I 'm trying to learn how to use variables from Jenkins in Python scripts.
I 'm just trying to adapt the Jenkins scripts so they are parameterized so we do n't have to modify the Python scripts for every release.
The Jenkins string parameters are "BranchID" and "BranchIDShort".
I added the part where we establish the variables from the Jenkins parameters, but I do n't know how to use them in the os.path.join() function.
In this case, when /code/ is /code/ in the job, /code/ will be used from Jenkins credentials list.
In this case, when /code/ is /code/ in the job, /code/ will be used from Jenkins credentials list.
We are running Jenkins 2.169 on Java 1.8.
It really seems like Jenkins 2.169 windows batch commands are the culprit and I am not sure how to resolve this.
We also tried running the commands using git bash 's shell from Jenkins and we get the same results.
I am working on a Python (2.7) script that runs a number of checks on a Jenkins node to make sure it is in compliance with all the other nodes.
I 've already tried looking into limiting it in Jenkins but it seems like you can only just limit the amount of parallel builds.
When you run the Jenkins project manually, they have a limit of active Selenium browsers at a time on that machine.
/pre/  Jenkins has a Pipeline Syntax Generator that can help in these cases.
Could it be anything to do with the fact that the jenkins container is in a swarm?
I have a bunch of html files from which I need to replace all the occurences of js(which are currently blocked by Jenkins) with a new js path.
I need to give a ternary operation in one of the "Environment" variable in Jenkins.
Do not use Groovy 's I/O functions as they would be executed on the Jenkins Master.
While running my below script from the jenkins 's execute shell option, I 'm getting -- [: 1 2 3 4 5 : integer expression expected, I tried using > symbol too without any lucks, I 'm not sure exactly where I went wrong.
I groom these strings from a multi line input in Jenkins like so .
Our Jenkins instance uses a number of executors in our little part of the AWS cloud.
Practically speaking, the only part of our pipeline that runs on the executors is the build step: Jenkins checks out workspaces to the build nodes (the executors) and performs builds on those nodes.
Almost everything else, and explicitly everything in Jenkins' so-called global shared libraries including the Kerberos code referenced in my original question, is actually run on master:  even when you wrap calls to a function in a global shared library in a node() step in your Jenkinsfile, those calls still run on master.
But since my Kerberos code was n't part of the build (or one of the other few steps, like sh(), that run on nodes in Jenkins), it was n't happening on the nodes: it was happening on the Jenkins master.
jenkins.queue.stuck means that the job is stuck in the queue even though all Node resources are available or there is an issue with the executor (if the job is starving for an executor for too long.).
jenkins.queue.pending means that the job is waiting for the next executor to run the job and all the node resources are health and reserved for the job.
jenkins.queue.buildable returns the total jobs which are in the buildable stage .
In Jenkins, however, It says that it ca n't find the element.
On my Jenkins CI, when installing dependencies from NPM, every dependency takes an enormous amount of time to load, even though they are loaded from the cache (304) (more than 10s for dependencies of less than 100b) .
/pre/  I need to set those variables in the  Jenkins nodes, before executing jobs remotely.
The fact that there are multiple spaces after each column might be confusing Jenkins .
I 'm writing jenkins pipeline script and using readProperties resource to get the variables from property files.
1) try some small width/height and execute it where the script usually succeeds, and see what happens 2) set to some large value and execute it on Jenkins, where it usually fails.
After all tests have run you publish the result file using an appropriate Jenkins plugin step (in my case /url/).
/pre/  Or else have a Jenkins pipeline job something like shown below.

when we run same collection with the help of newman on jenkins then all test are passed.
The solution is to use sshagent function in Jenkins Pipeline .
we are creating the automation in Jenkins having overall 12 Jobs.Is there any way to create the 4 Jobs only rather 12?
The second step was to include this new created function into my Jenkins groovy file.
In the basic Jenkins file I execute the function “file.deleteFilesOlderThanDays()” (for testing I do not use any parameters).
If I have a jenkins pipeline which is restricted to get executed on a specific label (say /code/) which has two or three machines/hosts/nodes (ex: host1,host2..) that are linked with it.
Is it guaranteed that jenkins will finish this job on same host/node /code/ with all the stages(build, lint ..) in the job?
We can restrict a job in Jenkins to run on a particular agent, but in that case I have to modify my all 100 Jenkinsfile to make them run only on master.

Google Chrome updated to version 73.0.3683.86 and Chrome driver was updated to 73.0.3683.68. when triggering a java project(TestNG) from Jenkins(as a service), the program runs indefinitely and does not get into the actual code and is timing out.
A manual jenkins job will be triggered, the maven release will build the artifacts according to the argument and the build procedure, in case it passes i want the job to trigger additional tests by calling other jenkins job, and only in case all passes to deploy it to artifactory.
/pre/  Supposing your script does not output anything, you can then instead output the variable to fetch it in Jenkins: .
I have a Jenkins container running inside an EC2-instance and I am trying to copy few files from the Jenkins container to the EC2-instance but it 's not working as expected.
I am using the below command to copy the file from the EC2 instance to the Jenkins docker container which is working as expected  .
I have a Jenkins Job that prints a list of elements either in Json or Text format,I am trying to setup a Jenkins job that would print the first element ,second element..... form a JSON or TEXT.And I wanted to assign it to a variable so i can retrieve any element using its number, "ex:- array[4]"  I am looking to read the output and print these values in shell.
I have compose.yml file where I have multiple containers with common image-tag variable and am passing the value of variable from Jenkins .
In your case since you are using a Jenkins pipeline to generate your artifacts instead of the OpenShift build process you really only need to combine your artifacts with your source code and the runtime container image.
I ran a Jenkins' job several times in the past 8 hours.
I want some boolean parameters in Jenkins Job.
/pre/  This process will change your default Jenkins port from 8080 to 80.  .
We have Jenkins Master with about 27K jobs at any point in time.
I 'm assuming that Jenkins script will choke if I merely code the second packaging step.
I am calculating the value of local variable (S_STACK_ID) inside dynamic stage of jenkins pipeline I need to pass S_STACK_ID variable to makefile so that it could be used in makefile to uniquely identify ECS Stack to be deployed .
How do I make Jenkins do what is has always done and use the job name as the workspace without the @# on the end?
The best lead I have is Jenkins is using that Groovy CPS thing, and maybe it might be screwing up rewriting the code for some reason.
I have built a jenkins pipeline using jenkinsfile which basically runs pylint and unit tests on my test branch (let 's say "devops" branch).
And so, all triggers (SCM, upstream...) that you declared in the pipeline wo n't be known by Jenkins, until you run the job a first time.
Saying in other words, these approaches should act same as View Results Tree Listener in /code/ but I do not know how to attach it to the /code/ in Jenkins.
I actually use it within my Jenkins pipeline, it works perfectly.
/pre/  Use case : Jenkins Pipeline .
Apart from the tedious duplication, a side effect of this is that in Jenkins, the "stage" view becomes longer and longer.
I am trying to write a jenkins declarative pipeline code to execute a shell script and capture the exit status of the code.
It is not clear whether you want a version number defined inside package.json or the jenkins build number as the previous answer gave you.
In case you want a version number defined inside your package.json you could fetch it with /code/ inside a jenkins shell command and then use docker build as the above answer suggested.
ssh -i aws_jenkins.pem ec2-user@34.217.129.89 .
This is the batch command I 'm using to try to run the unit test after being committed to Jenkins.
I used to run one of the Jenkins job which was working fine from long back.
/pre/  What 's the way to do this when I run the app from a Jenkins job?
I guess in case of Jenkins you want static volume like /url/.
I want to store the output of that .sh file to a variable which can be used inside the Jenkins groovy pipeline.
So I have created a shared library in jenkins with a listener that gets triggered each time the pipelines reads a FlowNode so I can run groovy code before and after each stage, step, etc... .
I am trying to abort the jenkins pipline project from the stage which executes the if else shell condition.
I want to abort the jenkins build when the if condition is executed.
In general, Jenkins assumes that all objects are serializable, since it would like to pause/resume jobs.
I 'd say, either you replace the UpdateWithCleanUpdater with a manual script (by calling your local svn client; some examples /url/); or you could fork or contribute to the Jenkins /url/.
Default 8080 was busy so Jenkins works on 8083.
But the parameter Jenkins URL was set on 8080.
run this .bat file from windows scheduler, but despite the fact that I have set the priority 4, the Jenkins runs terribly slowly.
The Jenkins is running on Windows server 2016. .
In order to execute my tests in any jenkins agent without needing any extra setup, I wanted to have everything running in Docker.
I am running Jenkins on a VM with CentOS7 and a slave with Windows 10. .
Couple of scenarios I have tested  1. setting up Jenkins on high-performance server ie 64GB Ram 16Vcpus and 300GB of Harddrive 2.
Expecting Jenkins to be as fast as possible .
You will however likely have to use a pipeline (Jenkins, GitlabCI,...) to do this... .
I 'm currently building a Jenkins pipeline that will run several thousand tests nightly, and then based on the time it took for each file in the suite to run, splits up our tests into N groups that will run in an equal amount of time.
Since this is usually (but not always) a serial process that sounds like a pipeline (which was introduced in Jenkins/Hudson) and people started calling processes like this Pipelines.
Is it possible to print cucumber feature file steps to Jenkins console while execution is in progress?
I am writing a first groovy script in the Jenkins, have an upstream /code/ which calls /code/.
Hi…I am running my Jenkins job on windows os.
I want to understand a portion of code of my Jenkins 's pipeline based on groovy DSL and closure.
/pre/  I want to understand the groovy / jenkins mechanisme that when the closure is called the map config is set with the variables var1 and var2.
/pre/  This starts off with Jenkins pipeline parameter syntax: /url/ and using some basic pipeline steps: /url/ such as /code/ and /code/ interspersed with standard groovy for your conditional logic.
While running ansible playbook for the first time, it got successful but jenkins not up and running and same playbook running in second time jenkins up and running fine.
/pre/  If I have a parent suite which comprises of children suites as below, and if I would like to create a Jenkins job to execute this parent suite, is there any way to execute these children suites in parallel[internally each child suite will execute it 's test cases parallel]?
I 'm currently reworking/improving some regression suites that run in Jenkins, and one of the main improvements I want to make is to reduce test times, parallel execution is one of the obvious solutions to this.
You can schedule Jenkins job that will be triggered at certain intervals.
So this can be done, however I do recommend putting the functions I have outlined below in a Jenkins Shared Library.
You can let Jenkins select one of your nodes from a subset by assigning the same label to multiple nodes.
I have a shell task in jenkins that executes a java program.
I can see the output of the program in the Jenkins Consule Output but it 's always in plain text, i.e.
I 'm setting up the pipeline in jenkins it have the dependant jobs since it needs the parameter form the previous builds but when it is triggered it should not wait for the previous builds it should be triggered and the build should be runs independantly.
Jenkins file Run job-1  Run job-2 - deploy in lower environment  Run job-3 - /code/  Run job-4  Run job-5 - after 3hrs  .
In the Jenkins examples here ... [/url/ ... the enclosures are returned from a function /code/ and by doing this I was able to force early evaluation of the strings and so get parallel steps running on both slaves.
As several people had pointed out, Jenkins assumes one job per repository.
Basically, you lost history data (Jenkins has no idea it is building different stuff at every iteration).
then forget it") to enhance its decision tree, and at the end, trigger that single job on Jenkins with all parameters you were able to capture.
Since I was actually using a Jenkins instance, my tool was a man-in-the-middle-broker.
Never really used the Jenkins declarative pipeline before but I think the way you refer to params is incorrect?
/pre/  This suggests that your Jenkins job is attempting to execute a Shell script block on Windows using /code/, which wo n't execute the contents of the shell script.
I am elaborating the procedure to follow using Jenkins pipelines, if not now at some point of time you need to move your build and deploy to pipelines for Infrastructure as code.
The easiest approach would probably be a pipeline in Jenkins (or whatever your build server is), but you can also write a shell script that calls Maven thrice.
Parameters in jenkins are available under the "param" variable.
We are considering ways to report these results and possibly integrate the report into our CI (Jenkins).
Tests are being executed via Jenkins on a docker instance (python:3.7-alpine3.9).
You can use a /url/, but since Jenkins does n't serialize lazy /code/s you 'll have to return it from a /code/ method like so: .
I 'm searced how to trigger jenkins build in monorepo projects and I find this way using changeset  "when" block combined with the built in "changeset" condition to conditionally run only certain stages of mymonorepo 's pipeline.
What is the value of the $E environment variable in Jenkins or how might I find the value of this variable?
Now i am using a simple batch execution within Jenkins Job to run  this script.
How do i make jenkins to replace that within the script when it executes it actually .
Jenkins pipeline I need to execute the shell command and the result is the value of def variable.
The actual solution was to clear the cache of Jenkins' VM and it will work.
I need to do some SQL operations in jenkins pipeline.
The Node labels are case sensitive in jenkins.
So, When you write (Windows || windows) as a target node, jenkins will first try to run the job on the agent with label "Windows" in case if that agent does n't respond then it will try to run the same job on the second agent with label "windows".
In this case when you run that job with target label "windows", jenkins will send the request to both nodes but jenkins will run the job on the agent which will respond first.
I have two jenkins instances, machine-1 and machine-2 Job-1 from machine-1 will trigger job-1 on machine-2.
That said, the Jenkins image defins a volume at /var/jenkins_home which blocks your ability to extend the image with a RUN command that changes that folder.
I was able to get this resolved by passing arguments for the powershell script through jenkins :- .
This force sets the values for the params within the script at run time and at the same time can be issued via jenkins to be able to make use of its environment variables.
I am running testcases in jenkins, and execution time from TestCaseExecutor is sent in ms. Do we need to make any change in JUnit plugin, for jenkins 2.16 to process milliseconds as is and convert into seconds, if duration is greater than 1000ms, similar for hours, days etc?
Try to reduce JENKINS_JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xmx3000m to JENKINS_JAVA_OPTIONS="-Xmx1500m and test and run.
First some background, i run the jobs with Jenkins, and for every JMeter job, i need to create the csv file with all the user data for the test, i made a CLI application in java 11 that make that.
For a declarative Jenkins pipeline, 2 of the 3 stages show the elapsed time, but in the last stage (stage 3) it shows /code/ and /code/.
Requirement: In jenkins pipeline, between stages user will receive an approval email to approve the pipeline workflow and set the job sleep time to postpone the stage (consider which will be for higher environment).
The solution in my case was to run groovy extraction code via the Jenkins terminal (assuming one has administrator access).

/pre/  Jenkins is not even checking out code from the repository, It is on a windows machine and the version of Java is 10 can anyone help?
On Jenkins I have THESE codes as a windows batch command .
It works If I put the function in a Windows batch command, but I loose links that is show in Jenkins' main page.
Often the reason is that of the hundreds of possible Jenkins plugins a few particular ones are needed but not yet installed.
Trying to run 2 selenium jobs parallel in Jenkins.
I scheduled a job to run for Every 6 hour per day in Jenkins .

To save a large hit on productivity, a better alternative is to replace these scripts with a Jenkins build server and a pipeline onfiguration.
I want to see on jenkins whether our code coverage is improving or degrading.
Now if we go with 2 separate Jenkins masters, one per environment, how can the pipeline still work?

I have a nodeJS script that returns non-zero exit codes and I 'm running this script with Powershell plugin in Jenkins in a pipeline job.
when running tests in jenkins, using MSTest, web call returns 404.  the reason is that url address includes a "/" char.
As part of the code I want to copy some files from windows server to this linux server so that jenkins jobs can read it and process with further tasks.
In this case when you run that job with target label "windows", jenkins will send the request to both nodes but jenkins will run the job on the agent which will respond first.
The amount of missing branches declined significantly after keeping the Jenkins running all the time.

I have Jenkins on Centos server with only one job calls "HOMEPAGE".
As you can see, the number of the HOMEPAGE folder is not consistent with executor_number variable in Jenkins.
I am new to Jenkins and making the Jenkins image inside the docker in ubuntu 18.04. .
We could kick it off as part of our Jenkins pipeline scripts, but that would just move the problem from 'updating the branches in the scanning schedules' to 'updating 50+ scripts' (or one parameterized list, which is better, but not ideal)   .
From what I understood, you have a python script which you want to run on Jenkins.
Will polling every second from multiple Jenkin jobs continuously use more resources on Jenkins server?
Sometimes when I run a test on jenkins with logical OR tag selection (karate.options="--tags @vld,@command-composition") the tests are executed unitl the end but will never step out of  .
Goal: override a Jenkins Boolean parameter default value (true) with false when I build from another Jenkins script .
They did, however, show me how to use parameters when calling one Jenkins script from another.
Jenkins is running on Windows 10 .

Also make sure to add that /code/ otherwise any other command revolving around Jenkins will fail.
I wrote below code to execute jobs in sequence in Pipeline script Jenkins, but I have a requirement to run 'build' and 'Undeploy' from below as parallel and then 'Deploy' after that .
My test cases are not running in Jenkins in headless mode.
One thing I noticed though is that if I add the variable as a Global Environment variable in Jenkins' configuration page, the plugin properly expands it and is able to get the value.
You may also use env variable for the different parameters (jenkins master, user, token, ...).
/pre/  Does someone have an idea why it is slow when started over Jenkins (~8 times slower)?
I am trying to set Jenkins job with parameters, that one of the parameters will decide the branch.
here I 'm triggering my Jenkins job from URL with some parameters and trying to get that parameter values in my pipeline script .
But in a little while the job starts executing and then passed the build again in Jenkins?
I 'm trying to swap part of a string in groovy when Jenkins runs the pipeline.

I have a multibrach Jenkins pipeline job which accepts some parameters from users following 'Build with parameters' option.
I 'm attempting to move our large FPGA build into a Jenkins CI environment, but the build hangs at the end of synthesis when run in a Docker container spawned by Jenkins.
You need to mount the workspace of your Jenkins job (containing your python project) as volume (see "docker run -v" option) to your container and then run the "next step" build step inside this container.
On execution of jenkins job, new image build and deployed in ECS cluster succesfully.
In case you are running more db containers and you want to make dumps you should automate this process somehow for example as Jenkins job that has access to your containers, or some scripts run as cron job on your docker host - it all depends what tools you are using.
This removes to setup everything on jenkins host means you dont need to install dependencies to run your pipeline code on host, for example, if you are trying to execute some nodejs code in pipe, you need to setup nodejs on Jenkins host before you run the pipe, to get rid of this you can run pipe in container where everything is pre-setup.
Given: Running jenkins on docker from Windows Plan on fetching code from github, building the solution, running functional tests, etc on a container somehow .
(5) I stop my current container "myJenkins" and create a new container with the command "docker run –name myJenkins2 -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -v ~/Jenkins:/var/jenkins_home/ new_jenkins_image".
Actually, this script is to be used in Jenkins, so just wondering as how will it know if the build succeeded or not.
This should be the way when a Jenkins Job is gathering stuff from other Jobs.
Is there a way to change app.properties with respect to my Jenkins build parameter and run the program with that configuration?
We 're currently experimenting with having each Jenkins run delete the workspace folder as its first action, as we do n't need old artifacts as part of our CI process, just the products of the last test action.
What ideally I need to do is run a Jenkins pipeline that will run immediately after I start the execution , checking out code, running a build but just running the deployment in a particular date/time.
So Would it be possible to schedule a particular step in jenkins pipeline?
I am using jenkins in order to run my tests in one of my tests (my test support 24 hour clock) I have to set time when I setting 10:00 it automatically saves it to 22:00 (I have no ability to define if it is AM or PM in the application itself).
When I run my test locally (without using jenkins) it sets the time as I expect (10:00 am) what I need to add to my webdriver profile in order to solve this issue?
The is no such way to schedule the steps of the Jenkins Job.
I am refactoring my Jenkins Job DSL script to make it more maintainable, and one of the main parts of that is splitting the code up into multiple files.

Through the Jenkins pipeline, I need to stop any previous run &amp; &amp;start new Selenium Hub (on Linux), stop any previous run &amp; start new Selenium node (on Windows).
I 'm completely stuck on how to approach this short of hardcoding the path where the templates would be output to locally, and then copying them to the jenkins node.
For achieving this with CI on jenkins I used pm2 to run the process in background so it can go for next stage.
I have added ssh key but I do not know how to use it from the command line, hence Jenkins "shell script" .
I am creating two environment variables in my Jenkins Pipeline, .
/pre/  If 8080 is already in use, you can use 8081 but forward it to 8080, as jenkins starts on 8080 .

If I 'm running Jenkins on a Linux container, is it possible to create a windows container for my pipeline job?
I 'm looking for the proper solution platform to run several Java scripts, before taking time into learning Jenkins, I need someone to help me confirm if my case can be performed in Jenkins.
If I 'm running Jenkins on a Linux container, is it possible to create a windows container for my pipeline job?
If I have commit 1000 synced to git, then commits 1001 and 1002 both come in nearly simultaneously, the Jenkins pipeline might run 1002 before 1001.
You could call the batch file inside shell script which has option to return value inside Jenkins pipeline.
/pre/  in jenkins, catch that output and assign it to your variable.
In the batch file I have one variable "FailProcessList" whose value i need to return back to Jenkins and store it in a variable in Jenkins pipeline.
Below is the way by which I using to exit from the batch and return error code to Jenkins.
/pre/  What is actually expected is to access and store the variable "FailProcessList" of batch file in Jenkins pipeline variable.
Third step: In jenkins you can use the environment variables /code/ and /code/.
The Jenkins yamlRead reads 'off' and transforms it to a boolean with value 'false'.
Use /url/ for that task in order to trigger other jobs from jenkins file.

I have an installation of Jenkins on my windows 10 machine and I 'm trying to run the basic node.js pipeline example.
For instance, one might have other systems that monitor Jenkins jobs.
I have some Jenkins pipeline jobs that run on multiple windows machines.
/pre/  Next caveat: If the server answers with a 302 redirect, like jenkins does, you might have to /url/: .
It will be run by Jenkins job and what I can see with this code is just while loop and when it counts up to 5 just go further.
Your Jenkins job can be configured to be triggered by a webhook, which would take care of the first part (every time I commit).
If you have multiple nodes or execute the pipeline concurrently Jenkins might not look in the same directory in which you compiled the binary.
2 - You can execute automation test without launching Katalon Studio by using command line mode execution, you could use Jenkins to run a command line script.
RESOLVED - Environment variables can be injected particarly for the parameter via the Jenkins job UI  .

But, if any of the jenkins job is running and branch is updated then three separate pipelines are created for same commit ID, one for one jenkins job.
I 'm trying to call parameterized jenkins job.
/pre/  NOTE : When I execute my script from outside jenkins then this works.
Even for a small project, recording a single PUT of a JAR file in this way will increase both the build time and the size of your build logs by several orders of magnitude (this is what I was experiencing in my build environment), which can easily cripple your entire Jenkins server.
Jenkins Master (whatever OS you are comfortable on) .
We have a Jenkins pipeline job that makes the following call on the "master" branch: .
What I would like to get: Jenkins executes unit/integration tests, builds artifacts and then triggers Codepipeline, which deploys CF stacks and performs end-to-end tests.
/pre/  What I do not like is that I need to look separately to the results of Jenkins job execution and to results of Codepipeline execution.
docker run -d -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home -p 8080:8080 -p   50000:50000 jenkins/jenkins:lts this will run Jenkins in detached mode   with port forwarding and volume added.
How to get the instance name from Jenkins script console by writing groovy script.
   How can I access to Jenkins PVC from cronjob in order to do some batch procedures on PV?
/pre/  But in this case, Jenkins does n't show me a new initial password for this second time: .
If I delete a container.. How Docker/Jenkins knows that is not the first time I try to install jenkins?
How can I access to Jenkins PVC from cronjob in order to do some batch procedures on PV?
The objective is to load parameter values dynamically from inside a Jenkins declarative pipeline.
For a separate job I can select the particular quality gate from jenkins pipeline code to check and analyse my code.
One approach to this problem is to use a CI/CD tool such as Jenkins or even some CI/CD bash scripts and have a sort of tagging strategy.
Enabling port 8080(Jenkins default), 80, 443 in the inbound rules.
Our current jenkins does not use docker in any way, the nodes are always running.
In both cases, the jenkins tries to start another container in the agent container.
The variable /code/ is defined in the jenkins global variables and is the docker network ip of the host, where the docker engine is running on.
Since last week docker keeps on running 20 container, but Jenkins is just using 4 .
When I run docker system prune -a, jenkins manages to grap 4 out of the 20 that immediately starts up .
Until last week, if you deleted a container from docker as well as from jenkins (under nodes), it would ONLY spin up a new container when needed.
Reason for this question is, if two Jenkins slave build the same branch code, am wondering the /code/ value to be same.
To list all the other ways Jenkins is better than Hudson would require a million monkeys writing the works of Shakespeare!
Jenkins is creating separate workspace when running parallel nodes, but those temporary workspaces do n't have all the files as original workspace.
Does node() support if/else condition in Jenkins pipelines?
I would like to have stages depend on each other to run in a Jenkins pipeline.
Is there any possibility to have multiple Jenkins jobs running with different test runners with 20 features in each?
The whole idea is to split these features into smaller chunks and run them in parallel on different jenkins servers.
I need to get access to the Jenkins environment variable from within the application 's code.
I am running Jenkins on window-10 for practice.

I have a Jenkins job that sometimes runs for more than 1 hour, sometimes it just runs for few seconds.
I want to run jenkins same job on multiple node.
I have create same label name in my all node, but when running pipeline jenkins run job only on one of them.
I 'm new to Jenkins pipeline, I want to know whether I can skip same steps in different jobs where one of it has finished.
As a workaround to get failed stages from Jenkins build such function can be used.
But this code requires to run without Groovy sandbox or you need to whitelist a lot of Jenkins method signatures (which is not recommeded).
Jenkins is a large tool with lots of functions, one function let Jenkins listen on Webhooks send out by GitHub when the master (or any other branch) changes.
I 'm moving some of these build jobs to jenkins pipelines and am trying to find if there is a way to source the variables from that file inside the jenkins environment stage so it can be used throughout the build pipeline 's subsequent steps.
The IP for the VM is 192.168.56.2 and I have no trouble accessing both Jenkins and Nexus on ports 8080 and 8081 respectively.

when I try to run my python scripts (code includes connecting to SQL server database with windows authentication mode) from Jenkins using windows batch command, the job fails as it is considering as my machine name as username instead of windows username .
The easiest way would be to use the Jenkins environmental variable GIT_LOCAL_BRANCH instead of GIT_BRANCH.
You can see the full list of Jenkins environmental variables at /url/ .
Jenkins does n't seem to be able to output this in a simple way, without all the stack traces.
You can use the /code/ step from /url/ (Minimum Jenkins requirement: 2.130).
In Jenkins,I start a job with Execute Windows batch command .
This seems a memory allocation issue.But I am not sure how to deal it with JAVA-Xms &amp; Xmx because my jenkins job is not configured with maven .

I Have TestNg Class look like the following code: And I have On Jenkins two jobs: job1 and job2 job1 to execute TestsFluxPro   and job2 to execute TestsVente tests  my question is how to configure Jenkins to tell in each job run the chosen class test for example in job 1 I want to execute com.
It provides a script to set parameters such as the JVM memory allocation and the port number that Jenkins runs on - if you use the JAR file you’d have to write a script yourself.
Alternatively , from Jenkins too I was able to perform the same operation.
I have a Jenkins pipeline which has 10 Jobs configured to run one after the other in the post build action.
I am trying to escape single quotes in parameters that are passed to a Bash script which is run on Jenkins.

I have integrated the Selenium Code with jenkins to execute the test cases with following steps: .
Schedules the steps contained within the block to run by adding an item to the Jenkins queue.
However, implementing /code/ blocks in a Scripted Pipeline provides clearer visualization of each `stage 's subset of tasks/steps in the Jenkins UI.
At the same time the Jenkins job executes a bash script when called.
You can use GIT_URL environment variable of jenkins.
Output to a file from the script and have either ansible thread or Jenkins pipeline thread watch and tail the file (both seem kludgy as this blurs the separation of concerns coupling my build server to the deploy scripts a little too tightly) .

Bind your existing docker daemon from the host into the run-time of the Jenkins container.
/pre/  I 'm not even able to split the string on a new line within Jenkins pipeline script .
I have set up Jenkins test jobs that will run Cucumber tests and want my jobs to always be successful up until a certain threshold (which I am controlling).

I have a Jenkins declarative pipeline (Jenkins version 2.138.3) On Jenkins screen why do i see that the same stage say 'compile' is being executed on the same executor....?
I want to be able to run a Jenkins job that spins up a Windows AWS EC2 instance for me.
The logic I can think is to exit 1; in bash script upon poll checking the docker status say every 4 secs to fail the Jenkins job.
I understand that this is not an ideal solution as the Jenkins job would fail after 2 secs and not immediately.

We use Jenkins as our CI, and as we have a relatively large number of branches in our system we encounter some issues with build time.
While the latter option is too expensive in disk space and the need to reclone for every branch, the former option makes the Jenkins rebuild on every push.
currently I have a jenkins job that uses ssh agent and a shell script to execute the tasks I need to take the code from the repository, run unit test, create docker images and deploy the container and it works as expected but every time I need to do a change I need to update the script instead of having all the benefits of a pipeline.

I found ways like CI jenkins integration and a maven artifactory plugin, but i would want something in batch script which i could call in my code.
Job DSL scripts are executed on the Jenkins master node, but the seed job 's workspace which contains the script files may reside on a build node.
If not, you would not be able to reference them (like your VM) as "node" in a Jenkins pipeline.

I want to return the value from groovy function back to my jenkins build stage so that the value can be used as a condition in other stages.
I had a Jenkins instance with version 2.138.3.
We use the /url/ v1.38 in our Jenkins pipelines.
Since you are exporting ruby path in the PATH variable, you need to source .bash_profile at the beginning of your jenkins job so that it will export the variables for that shell/job.
New versions of Jenkins have capped this to never go over 15 seconds (see /url/ ).
/pre/  I would suggest providing a delay so that the executing context from Jenkins has time to release the agent.

i am using Windows server 2012 to perform all the Jenkins activity.
Is there any a way to configure the jenkins slack plugin to alert in a channel after something has been in a stage for a certain period of time?
I believe this happens because the Jenkins agent is not allowed to execute from C:\Windows\System32 on Windows 10 when running in the user context.
Mostly my solution works for single node Jenkins(i.e.
This step helpful as Jenkins needs some disk space to perform builds and keep archives.
Jenkins job are meant to be self sufficient or based on input parameter or even linked.
If you want to run one script on its own, you need to split your Jenkins job into 3 different jobs and link them (ie : pushing parameter) .
Jenkins job or pipeline input are displayed before job really start.

/url/, also called a Flyweight Executor, is a thread on your Jenkins master that tracks and coordinates a pipeline build.
I 'm using some of the jenkins variables plus some defaults for local testing to get it closer, but it 's not 100% certain due to the way the pipeline was set up.
I am creating a job which would deploy the code on ec2 instance and there I would like to run some test cases on it with jenkins.
I will be applying the conversion logic in a Jenkins pipeline as well.
I mean, I agree that this is the right behavior in most of the cases, as you do n't want your parameter to be out of synch and not versioned, but is there a way to specify to Jenkins to skip the parameter reconfiguration or to override the default parameter written in the Jenkinsfile?
In my jenkins job contain string /code/.
I know about Jenkins use the Groovy syntax rules for variable expansion but I expected some variable values where fully resolved.
Example: When I run my jenkins jobs with build parameter for example, I am entering browserName as InternetExplorer it should replace the value in the settings.properties file.
During the job generation on Jenkins, we have successful results when we specify one specific job / folder.
The challenge here is that i need to pass the actual build number to some further downstream jobs as parameter (I 'm using jenkins parametrised trigger plugin).
/pre/  How would you get the build number from anther jenkins job.
So Jenkins instance which is running in command line inside the server is also closing.
Creating a task scheduler to run Jenkins through command line is not helping since i 'm  running test automation scripts where the chrome browser is not opening if i schedule a task.
How can I stop a process running through jenkins after some time?
1 ) Open the jenkins.xml file  2 ) Search for the "--httpPort=8080" Text and replace the port number 8080 with your custom port number (like 7070 , 9090 ) 3 ) Go to your services running your machine &amp; find out the Jenkins service and click on restart.
I need to declare few parameters in Jenkins(2.192) for my project but I do n't see the option.

I 'm running on the Jenkins pipeline, so I have set the value to /code/ in slave configuration after I have run my jobs my slave but when the other job needs to run if a slave agent is full, jobs are waiting on Build Queue.
I want to run a job in parallel on all 3 nodes, to clean the workspace folder on them To achieve that, I wrote this Jenkins script .
/pre/  So I thought with node(target) in the cleanWsTasks function I already told Jenkins to restrict the execution of the task only on the particular target node I want.
/pre/  this statement has worked successfully where ${DB_PASSWD} and ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_PASSWORD} are actually a parameters defined in jenkins global credentials variable i.e.
def busyExecutors = Jenkins.instance.computers                           .collect {c -> c.executors.findAll { it.isBusy() } } .
I tested different ways to scan multiple docker images in both Jenkins freestyle and pipeline projects but every time I run jenkins build, scan result gives a report for only one image.
/pre/  "I expect to see multiple Anchore Engine image scan reports in one jenkins build, but I am only seeing only one image scan report instead of multiple images."
I ca n't run my tests inside of the container because the code I 'm testing lives outside the container and triggered the jenkins pipeline to begin with.
But this just displays it,as binary characters in the Jenkins console window.
I am trying to setup Jenkins pipeline that will execute specific Python code and run flask.
So I put exit(1) in the last line of matlab script.But Jenkins console output still reveal SUCCESS.And I use %errorlevel% in batch command line,the result was 0 not what I expect.
It seems to me like a simple problem that I could solve with a bit of JS, but I am very unfamiliar with Jenkins and do n't really know where to start.

Also the only active node in Jenkins nodes was master node and nothing else.
I want to run a job "main_job" N number of times in parallel from a pipeline "main_pipeline" depending upon the parameter N. But I cannot get around jenkins errors where it allows "for" loop in script blocks but not in "parallel" blocks.
Instead of calling /code/ from Jenkins, call /code/ to get the v3 interpreter.
I would expect jenkins to start the slave even if I use a image from gcr.
The script runs for 4 hours when I run it manually, but every time I run it from Jenkins it stops at 1 hr and 1 minute.
PS: I know i can block some jenkins builds while running others but that 's far from optimal - each jenkins job completes in 1-2 hours, and gradle takes only about 2/3 of it, about 2/3 time of which takes in turn c++ code compiling .
I wrote a Jenkins pipeline script to run some newman tests with a pre-request script, but the variable defined in the pre-request script is unkown during the running of tests.
To map this port you need -p 7600:7600 when starting Jenkins container.
/pre/  i am running jenkins 2.176.2 .
Now, what we are facing is, when we are running the test cases via Jenkins, then what we want to achieve is a method where we can call our Junit test cases separately like before the deployment and Integration Test cases separately(Cucumber Tests) like after the deployment.
Since the exit code of the script is n't 0 (either because that 's the last command you run, or because you /code/ in your script), Jenkins takes that as a failure.
But when I run "node -v" in Jenkins shell script then it says node not found.
Type /code/ in the slave agent and paste the path in the environment variables of the node in Jenkins .
I want to setup Jenkins pipeline that will ask me git tag every time I run the job.
I see you 're using start, this may block the exit code from reaching Jenkins .
So if you want Jenkins to get the errorlevel from the MATLAB command, but you do want to run something after matlab, you should probably capture it in a separate variable and "reset" the errorlevel just before exiting the script, e.g.
I am using a spot instance for Jenkins and i have configured the allure plugin as per the documentation given, and every time i run a job i can see the allure history and other graphs but not the allure trend graph, since i use the spot instance, the instance will die once the job is completed will not be able to see the workspace later.
My Jenkins job sends an E-mail (/code/ block) in case if /code/ build and it should contains the variable from properties file but it does n't see this variable.
Since 2.60, Jenkins has required Java 8 jvm to run.

I have two stages which are in same Jenkins files,The requirement is i want to stash a repository on stage('AAA') and unstash from the another kubernetes pod within stage('BBB')  .
We have this Jenkins multi-branch pipeline which has been there for a long time.
In my experience from previous work, the best exaples are: The server starts being bloated after some time, Jenkins does n't work the most important times that you need it, The application you have deployed does not work because Jenkins has too many jobs that takes all the resources.
This keeps Jenkins alive all the time.
If you are planning to use the environment as it is, you can keep the value that you are going to set as environment variable inside Jenkins safely.
I am running the JMeter scripts in Jenkins and want to fail the job based on the 90th percentile value.
best solution I could do now is to calculate average response times and fail the transactions and provided 2% error assertion in the jenkins Perf Report.
The problem is that Jenkins starts a new instance of SoapUI instead of continuing in the same SoapUI instance.

Unfortunately, that did n't work either -- also, Jenkins did n't expand its /code/ environment variable:  .
I have tried one more thing of putting this groovy script in Jenkins managed files and give the id as a parameter to script as below , but still same issue: .
Even though environment variables are set in Jenkins Node and on the actual Node itself when I run the Jenkins job I get (No compiler is provided in this environment.
Is there a way to run this JDK compiler needed on the node itself without setting Jenkins Global configuration tool?
Now, I want to have this directory structure on Jenkins which it can refer while running test cases.
Jenkins runs with the kubernetes plugin to start up new instances of jenkins agents every time a job is submitted.
On Windows 10 (1903), I 'm running Jenkins in a Linux container.
Invalid type for parameter ResourceQuery.Query, value: [{'Key': 'name', 'Values': 'Jenkins'}], type: , valid types:  .
The problem is (our configuration, may be by policy) Jenkins can only run one instance of a job at a time, so the rest are queued, so often there are idle executors but pending jobs.
(Skipping this step returns 403 response from REST API even though the cookie was set from Step 2) Step 4: GET request to Jenkins REST API without any other parameters/headers works fine.
I thought it might be something to do with the way the Jenkins runner uses JAVA.
(Our Jenkins runner is using Java 8 32 bit).
I have a Jenkins build and in that I am providing a build parameter with uppercase value (Build parameter should be uppercase always), by chance if a user is providing a lower case value, the build should gets failed.
I need to schedule a Jenkins job which need to build every 2 and half hour(every 150 minute).
Also is it possible to run a Jenkins Job every 30 seconds and every 1 minute.
iam using mvn test command to run the job.. even I have tried in Jenkins machine and mvn command works.
I am looking for a nice way to include these benchmark results into a CI framework (currently Jenkins), such that it becomes easy to see whether a commit improves or degrades the analysis performance.
But I want run time arguments in my shell script by Jenkins 's Input method.
I am trying to use a node slave container in Jenkins to run npm instructions on it.
/pre/  One of my Jenkins job in the pipeline will execute above code and the value returned by the code needs to be passed to a downstream job.
I am using Jenkins 'Node and Label parameter plugin' to run our java process on a slave node.
You can rely on Jenkins pipeline, depending on you input parameter, to run (or not) sub project .
May be you can write the output of java code to some file, and make that input for the next jenkins job.?
/pre/  Even jenkins run with become and becomeUser command .
(Which /url/ to   think that Jenkins has /code/ed the process.)
I have a freestyle job in Jenkins that runs a batch file with a series of file name as inputs.
The Jenkins job is simply running the first batch file which calls the second one that runs the pmd.
This is because with current definition of your 'jenkins' Deployment, under the hood the Deployment controller creates a ReplicaSet object, which by default ensures that only single instance of Jenkins Pod is running (= simplifying only single instance of Jenkins server will be writing to this volume at once).
I know we can set an Input Parameter, but i do n't know exactly how this works so it changes the type at the function, and how to configure Jenkins to send these parameters when running the build.
I have installed Jenkins(2.164) on Ubuntu(18.04) Azure VM calling that as master, and I created the one Windows 2016 data center server in Azure VM and attached to the master as Worker node.
If your Jenkins pod is running inside GKE, just go for /url/ and wrap your last step into small python/go script.
Even if someone can guide me in having a Jenkins job run on a single file of my choosing that will help a lot .
Jenkins groovy fails to take data with spaces while calling the script  .
Optional: how to scale jenkins worker/slave nodes?
I have a scenario where i 'm using port forwarding for a porting job(Scheduled every 3 hour via Jenkins) which will port the data from source to destination and it was working fine, usually the job takes around 1 hour to complete.
So i want to schedule my Jenkins job to reuse the port in such a way that these job schedules wo n't collide.
/pre/  I have mentioned the new job to be blocked when the main job runs, But since the new job runs every 5 minutes ,the port will be used by the new job and at that time if the timer starts the main job it will fail,So is there a possible way in Jenkins to retry the job in one or two minute after the failure?
If you mean that you wish to trigger Jenkins job without any git commit you can simply call it with a REST API.
The ANT target is of type -  with packageNames equating to the declared input variable being passed from Jenkins parameter.
Input is a Jenkins parameter and the parameter needs to be passed onto an ANT target.
The solution as suggested is a plugin, but I do n't want to increase the complexity to this solution because for this I will have to learn plugin development for Jenkins and seeing that it 's in JAVA, it will take even more time ( I am fluent in Python ).
I think that this may be the case because the build step in Jenkins invokes a powershell script that invokes a cake script.
/pre/  For the moment I 've ammended the Path environment variable under the jenkins global settings, that works, but, feels wrong...it makes the assumption that all my jobs require the same tooling and environment.
I was wondering if there is a way to tell jenkins to use default parameter values defined in job already.
In my Jenkins pipeline, there is a parameter that allows the user to add bash commands that will be executed in one of the stages (a behave stage).
Is there a way to tell the Jenkins or TestNG results parser that you want to see the the message for passing tests too?
What is the best way I can compile that code with Jenkins?
/pre/  After we got the first time 404 error, executing for a second time the Jenkins job, the download ends successfully: .
Create a jenkins job that runs every 15 or 30 minutes to check the DB status and run selenium script.
I 'm trying to get Jenkins CSRF crumb to call the job from Rest Api in Azure DevOps pipeline, but I ca n't assign the output of curl to a variable to pass to the next task.
jenkins.crumb is a variable from the group.
(That is, at runtime, Jenkins will set up classloaders in such a way that X classloader delegates to Y classloader.)
Here is the parameter definition in Restful API result when Jenkins build, you can see the parameter /code/ is an ExtendedChoiceParameter type .

Jenkins uses a /code/ call to execute this script.
The problem is that all variables are evaluated by jenkins when they 're in double quotes.
We had a requirement to mask password in Jenkins.Earlier the passwords were mentioned in Environment variables and accordingly used in groovy script as well.
I do n't want to manually configure my pipeline job in Jenkins every time container is up.
The answer from Anonymous Coward points to /url/, a high performance CRC reference implementation of a novel Multiword CRC algorithm invented by Andrew Kadatch and Bob Jenkins in early 2007.
Currently, when a new Dockerfile for Jenkins is checked in, I 'm running a bash script to safely shutdown Jenkins, explicitly wait for it to die by polling its REST API, replace its image, and then start its container again.
This is not hard to do except for the fact that the image from Jenkins already defines its own ENTRYPOINT and, consequently, I do n't see how I am able to call my own script that would handle that signal.
Also what 's the difference between running from the command line and Jenkins running the same commands.
Overview of the automation suite setup:- It contains Jenkins, Selenium Grid(multiple nodes), Surefire plugin with fork mode to kick off parallel execution.
I set up a jenkins in my k8s cluster with /url/ , when checking out code, it says  .
As Yong answered, every sh steps are independent, imagine Jenkins is opening a new ssh connection on your slave each time.
this is my parallel code from the jenkins file: .
Or you must mount a folder with the job-name as part of the filesystem-path (one jenkins-job run only once at a time).
If I run containers without jenkins and execute the  'service cups start' and  .
Is there a way to mark a test run failed if the number of tests decreases in jenkins.
Is there a way to say jenkins that in such case the test status should be red?
I cannot get Jenkins to pass a string Parameter down the pipeline.
If that 's the case, try changing Jenkins number of executors 1. .
[JmeterTest] $ cmd /c call C:\Windows\TEMP\jenkins1399437408540848331.bat .
It contains calls to inner methods of Jenkins which are deprecated (I guess).

/pre/  Jenkins pipline with the small shell script that will be running inside the container.
/pre/  Most of the jobs are running in Jenkins without any slave restrictions and we have it only for jobs, that must run on the redis-spot-fleet.
When passed from Jenkins the first space breaks the code and the second word in the string is treated like a seperate string.
The variable in question in the Jenkins file... .
By default dot does n't match line-ends, so if there is no "release" keyword on one of the lines in the commit message, the pattern would match on that line, and commit would be incorrectly ignored by Jenkins.
I am creating a python library containing common functionalities such as createFile, createFolder, checkIfFolderExists etc., Is it possible to import this library functions into Jenkins pipeline script (Groovy)?
I am using git hook to trigger Jenkins job automatically And time interval set in job config 'Scan Multibranch Pipeline Triggers' (Interval 30 min).
Checking out more than one repo at a time in a single workspace is possible with Jenkins + Git Plugin (maybe only in more recent versions?).
Setting an exit code that at least communicates success (/code/) vs. failure (nonzero, typically) is an important mechanism for letting outside callers know whether your PowerShell code succeeded overall or not, such as when being called from a scheduled task or from an automation server such as Jenkins via the PowerShell CLI (command-line interface) - /url/ for PowerShell Core vs. /url/ for Windows PowerShell.
in jenkins-pipeline, I 'm trying to use SED to append the following line to the end of a file.
What is the way to get environment variables in a Jenkins scripted pipeline?
suppose I have a method in a vars/method.groovy how can I pass the Jenkins environment variables into this method?
/pre/  Our CI pipeline runs in Jenkins, and we 're using the kubernetes plugin in order to get executors on-demand.
I have two separate functions in my Jenkins pipeline and i want to call 1st function from 2nd function.
/pre/  Here The problem is you are running Jenkins inside docker, so the rest of the container will only able to consume the Environment variable that is defined inside Jenkins Container.
To make all environment variables to Jenkins you need to update Jenkins run command.
/pre/  This will return Host user name that is /code/ so one should avoid this as all the environment variable of Jenkins container is override by host env.
The correct use of variables in Jenkins is the following: .
If you would use /code/ Jenkins would not notice that you want to access the variable and simply print your variable as string.
I want to run a groovy script on Jenkins to find and delete some files generated on nodes with a complex filter (filter in code below is just an simple example).
If it is a /url/, then case 1 will trigger it (which, in turn, will activate your listener, here a Jenkins instance).
In theory there can as many concurrent jobs as jenkins wants, but only one on any of the machines at a time.
I 've made a unit-test of a Service, when I execute the Jenkins job, every test method pass correctly, except one.
What I can assure, is that even in Jenkins, the /code/ method takes the parameters /code/, which is /code/ and the dateFormart String as /code/.
It would be much easier to first make it compiling and running locally, and only then put it to Jenkins.
I am writing tests using RobotFramework and executing them through Jenkins Pipeline.
Jenkins just checks if your shell script is executed or not and based on that it will return a status code which generally is  zero as it is executing the shell script successfully.
I am using Jenkins pipeline, I created 4 Jobs, each job has some functions and Their is a redundant function existing in all those Jobs.
I 'm trying to deploy to a node using jenkins, and even though the job recognises the node, when attempting to run the job turns to pending and tries to look through every environment for the node.
The past api_token version of jenkins allowed it to be html parsed, but I ca n't figure out a way to query it from the new version.
I 'm trying to run sql statements from Jenkins shared library.
We have been using EC2 Windows spot instance as Jenkins slaves, however, when increasing the size from M5d2XLarge to M5d4XLarge (in an attempt to overcome memory issues in some builds), those fail to be created.
You need to have Fastlane on the Jenkins but it is execution is easy and fast.
When trying to use a parameter reference in another parameter in Jenkins Groovy Script, it does not return the value.
I am trying to implement parallelization in my Jenkins pipeline code where I can run two stages in parallel.
I want to set node value as a Jenkins Scripted Pipeline parameter.
The PATH variable jenkins uses is probably different than the command line path you set.
To set the PATH variable in Jenkins: .
In my GitLab pipeline, a Python script is called that needs to access the Jenkins environment variables JENKINS_BUILD_USER_CREDS_USR and JENKINS_BUILD_USER_CREDS_PSW, see code.
This is not compiler/computer issue, because when I start compiling from command prompt (directly where the Makefile is), clean is perform quick, via Jenkins it stuck first time at: .
curl -X POST JENKINS_URL/job/JOB_NAME/build \   --user USER:TOKEN \   --data-urlencode json='{"parameter": [{"name":"id", "value":"123"}, {"name":"verbosity", "value":"high"}]}' .
But when running this on our Jenkins CI server (Ubuntu 16.04), the locust container is n't able to call the api.
I am running several jenkins services on a docker swarm and I want to use environment variables for some parts of /code/.
A credential-id with global scope is available to all jobs in Jenkins.
Ideally, this combined code coverage would then be available in Jenkins for viewing the job and the testing results as the additional REST calls would execute the code, and the passing Postman tests indicate that the code in question was covered via testing.
More than 90% time of jenkins deployment is wasted in checks like .
I am able to build in Jenkins using /code/, which automatically starts the application, but this results in a Jenkins build process that never finishes.
10:14:30    10:14:30 C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\workspace\PROJECT-NAME>exit -1  .
I am trying to run a selenium test through Jenkins with browser Stack If I run the test on Jenkin windows server command line, it works perfectly, but upon running on jenins it hangs.
I would like to pass parameters to our Catch2 tests via ctest when running through bamboo or jenkins so that they product junit test results.
note: Remember one thing if you are working at jenkins then first use /code/ and then /code/ command work for you because with previous code /code/ command store cache for dependency.
In Jenkins parameterized project, is there a way to receive the variable in different name?
I try to print two variables in Jenkins shell (one of which is global one) .
The only fix is to re-set this env variable in my jenkins job as well : .
The Jenkins job itself is using the pipelines feature, a groovy DSL script, one of the steps is a PowerShell block, and it calls some a function that invokes NAnt, after working out lots of parameters to be parsed in.
The PowerShell function is called, and it triggers NAnt, and for the nearly an hour that it takes to complete, you get the output, as it happens, showing up in Jenkins.
ReportPortal is intended for test execution results collection, not for jenkins logs gathering.
Jenkins.instance.getNode('').toComputer().setAcceptingTasks(false); Jenkins.instance.getNode('').toComputer().setEligibleForReuse(true); .
The job is run by Jenkins 2.95 on a schedule .
Nightwatch 0.9.21, Seleniun v3.9.1, Chrome webdriver 76.0.3809.68, Jenkins 2.176.1.
We have a Jenkins job that is parameterized that we run every night for our testing.
I have a simple batch script written in Jenkins scripted Pipeline, that is executing an .exe-file with its own parameters, but to run it in desired way, admin rights are necessary.
Is there a way how to force the Jenkins to run batch scripts in the background?
/pre/  Expected results: Output from batch scripts is being returned into the Jenkins' console at any circumstances.
Setting the variable in Jenkins itself does n't work too (I believe because the script is not executed during a build?).
It is worth noting that it is n't just my laptop that experiences the problem, but also I our build system (Jenkins under Windows vs. my laptop under Windows).
Tried Jenkins Global Security settings with fixed port 22, 50000 and random port setting.
/pre/  Here is my full jenkins file as requested, end goal i want to use val1 and val2 and env variables but if i can figure out how to to with hello world it is the same thing.
We currently run Jenkins on a Windows machine and the system log (/code/ and /code/) is growing quite huge.
I 'm calling test.groovy from jenkins by test(123) but it is not passing the value to its stages/pipeline .
It reduced the build time on our Jenkins server from 45 minutes down to 3 minutes by using precompiled binaries.
In this way, everytime we start tomcat, then Jenkins also gets running.
I am running a robot framework test case through Jenkins (with parameters, and in my test case, I set some environment variables.
When many Jenkins jobs are running concurrently, this may results in many concurrent unauthenticated connections to the SSH daemon, in which case sshd will start dropping connections.
Are you talking about Jenkins shared library, under your shared library vars folder you have this file called ‘tagdeploy.groovy’ which has a function call() - then you can call this inside scripted or declarative Pipeline using its direct name like a function call - tagdeploy() .
Create/change your Jenkins (I use portainer) with environment variables DOCKER_HOST=tcp://192.168.1.50 (when using unix protocol you also have to mount your docker socket) and append :/var/jenkins_home/bin to the actual PATH variable .
So let 's say for a simple test that take only 1 minute to run , but saving the artifacts from Jenkins slave to Jenkins master take around the same time or more before it 's considered to be passed.
The idea is Jenkins running on port 8080, with port 8080 exposed.
So I have to figure it out how to set up some Javascript unit tests for an app - specifically to get the "Test Results Analyzer" widget up and running on the Jenkins website.
Jenkins execute shell will work more reliable when you directly give the commands instead of shell name.
I say "where Jenkins is running" because it seems like you are confusing the execution space where the container is running with your local system 's execution space where docker is running.
The thing is that most probably Jenkins is spawning a container to run your build.
I get the variable from Jenkins 'build with parameter' but I ca n't put a " tag " variable in my script.
/pre/  In Jenkins use /code/ option while running the container to pass the environment variable inside the container for application.
This is set up as two separate Jenkins pipeline jobs, the parent job and the child job.
Note: My Jenkins instance currently runs on Windows 10. .
I can reach the jenkins instance using https and the nginx container ip from my machine.
The default port declared in the official image being 8080, I can still reach the jenkins instance with the jenkins container IP and the port 8080. .
Example What I want : Developers commit something in the GIT repository, Jenkins job will poll for any commits, now if Jenkins detect any changes then it should wait for 2nd commit within some time frame lets say 3 hrs, if Jenkins did n't find any more commits in the time frame of 3 hrs , it should start the job.
But If Jenkins find any commits then it should wait for remaining time or start the execution.
Your problem here is that all the $ are interpreted by jenkins when the string is in double quotes.
So the first 2 times there 's no problem since the first variable comes from jenkins and the second time it 's a single quote string.
The the third variable is in a double quote string, therefore jenkins tries to replace the variable with its value but it ca n't find it since it 's generated only when the shell script is executed.
Now, I can see that there is no more IP address for jenkins_ci container.
so after Jenkins job finish, what i want i could call that server API on my postman to test it  .
Here, I would like to pass one parameter to jenkins job, but do n't know how to do it.
The ideal solution will be even after the user cancels the running Jenkins job the /code/ script to continue running(in background) until completion.
I want to have two/three instances of jenkins master running.
In cases where it does work, even with privileged as an option inside the new container i cannot extract the tar.gz of JENKINS_HOME anywhere.
Now, what i want is that during build &amp; deployment in Jenkins pipeline, all Unit tests should get executed but not the Cucumber tests i.e.
/pre/  Note: As you would have noticed above, we are using single quotes in Groovy, so the variable expansion is being done by the Bourne shell, not Jenkins .
When my C++ program build script is called from a Jenkins job, it takes far more time to be built.
Start condition check Scripts not permitted to use staticMethod   jenkins.model.Jenkins getInstance.
Did you try to increase the memory allocated to jenkins as explained /url/?
Keep in mind that especially if Jenkins is running on a non-standard port (8080), other firewalls outside your control could still block the connection.
And Jenkins has it 's own workspace which is being used every time I start to sync the code.
This is due to the limitation is one of the libraries that Jenkins uses, namely XStream.
(I was previously running Jenkins LTS 2.176.3.)
These instructions appear to be specific to Jenkins instances running on Linux OS.
Any suggestions for getting any version of Jenkins to run with OpenJDK 11 or what my next steps should be here would be greatly appreciated.
I use jenkins to do so, I cerated a Pipeline in Which before starting the entire Test suite, I just run BVT Job, in which I just run Login test.
Installed python from scratch on computer and still throws an error anytime a .py file is being used whether it 's my short script 'print('aa')' or some other utility (Jenkins Job Builder) which uses python script underneath dropping this line: /code/ every time.
I 'm trying to use the TestComplete plug-in for Jenkins, but I 'm not sure how to pass command line arguments, or which ones I need.
I am trying to use Jenkins /code///code/ for the first time, and I am unable to successfully stash my files.
I have a job in Jenkins which needs parameters and it gets called from different places.
I am running a Windows command in a groovy file to run a Postman collection on a Jenkins Pipeline.
You can pass the dockerhub creds as environment variables at jenkins only and Imagepullsecrets are to be made as per kubernetes doc, as they are one time things, you can directly add them to the required clusters .
Are you trying to show test results in Jenkins job?
I 'm using Jenkins to trigger tests execution (Java+NestNG+Allure+Maven).
If the exit code of the first run is non-zero, no matter what result the second run gets, Jenkins exits with return code 1.
If the first run succeeds, the second run will determine the result of the Jenkins job.
I know how to plot a single file in Jenkins, but the issue is that I do n't know how to plot multiple files at the same time and on different plots.
There 's is no way you can run cron every 2 sec except a shell script or putting sleep in cron which might be of no help in Jenkins if you are looking for building something periodically.
Do n't run any scripts for this amount of time, use jenkins to run a simple script that: .
And schedule this to run every 1h or so every day but add a condition that if for example scripts were run this day, dont run this jenkins script today anymore.
I 'm trying to run a Windows command line executable on a Jenkins slave.
To further complicate matters, the executable uses Jenkins build variables as part of it 's command line options (specifically it operates on files that are contained within the WORKSPACE directory, so I 'm passing that as part of the command line).
Before I write the script for a third time, what is the best procedure for running an executable on a Jenkins slave?
I am trying to make a very simple regression model that (among other things), builds and compiles a GCC target for coverage, executes, and then publishes a standard Cobertura coverage report (all within Jenkins).
I have a jenkins job that makes an XML request and returns an answer.
Following one of the comments suggestions I have decided to increase the heap size of the Java machine on the homebrew.mxcl.jenkins.plist file: .
I have set up Jenkins with a master node with 4 executors, and one additional slave node, also 4 executors.
When I look at the load statistics graph for the entire Jenkins (/code/), then I see the 4 executors of the slave node.
Whereas when i run the same script from the Jenkins throws error as : org.openqa.selenium.ElementClickInterceptedException: element click intercepted: Element ... is not clickable at point (763, 142).
Normally when i run in Eclipse,I comment out the headless mode,Window size commands and will be run in Jenkins.
The thing is, this variable may be present or not depending on Jenkins global configuration.
I have a job in jenkins to run a few Python test suites and generates the console output.
Is there any way I can get the logs in jenkins separated by my test cases in a particular test suite?
If I have the Version ARN of a layer, is there a CLI command that I can use to in my Jenkins that will attach the layer to my lambdas function?
Your attempt does not work because Jenkins runs the shell with the errexit (-e) option enabled and that causes the shell to exit right after the pytest command before it reaches your if statement.
I have a docker installed on Linux machine, I have a container with Jenkins that trigger a job, my final step is to run tests, one of my first steps in my Nunit tests is to connect to MongoDB that also a part of my docker stack.
My problem is, that the script is called by a jenkins, so the variable of arguents are set automatically to a list or to nothing.
If you 're facing this issue in the same situation,   modify jenkins.xml to use a different, 64-bit version of JRE and also   increase the max heap allocation (e.g.
I am trying to package the vanilla Jenkins image into Docker using this tutorial: /url/ Everything works until one of the last steps where the Dockerfile tries to run /code/ from a /code/ file that was just copeid into its own directory.
Step 1: Open gitbash and run docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 jenkins.
I have a simple Jenkins pipeline which calls a PS file.
In our Jenkins build step we then have the control dynamically load up the script and invoke the function passing in any parameters.
So I decided to start jenkins on some other port (say 7070).You can do this by using below commands.
is there anything i am missing to make the jenkins run the 2nd iteration of "round_${b}".
The output of this python eval looks like it could be stages in a jenkins pipeline .
192.168.1.100:8080  -----> jenkins server ubuntu .
how to redirect jenkins to 192.168.1.99:8080 ????
/pre/  Not sure if syntax is is 100% correct, but you can easily figure out what you want to achieve starting from this /url/ , which is a root model for your jenkins instance where you can fetch any possible data you may need.
With Gradle you can have building caches that really speed up you process, but it is kind of hard to make this happen inside a Jenkins job that has its own set of build artifacts for every job execution.
I want to write a groovy script that would be used in jenkins to fetch the list of successful Builds in last 7 days.
In theory test should run with features alphabetical order, at local machine it 's exactly like that, but in Jenkins order is not alphabetical.
/pre/  What I want is firstly run my test cases ('test1,'test2') form cmd line after then I can use them with Jenkins to CI/CD (Note that I 'm a student at Uni.
When I try to build my jenkins job, it prints /code/, but gets stuck at the next instruction i.e.
Here is what i did on ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Jenkins 2.176.2 .
On Jenkins Pipeline, is there a way to define a global variable as a Linux command (at *****)?
def SECOND_WORD=sh(script : "echo ${JENKINS_PROJECT_NAME} | cut -d'_' -f2", returnStdout: true).trim() .
def SECOND_WORD=sh "echo ${JENKINS_PROJECT_NAME} | cut -d'_' -f2" .
def SECOND_WORD=$(echo ${JENKINS_PROJECT_NAME} | cut -d'_' -f2) .
I am automating our jenkins slave creation process using python and i am designing a function that takes the slave name and the json file as input and creates a new jenkins slave in my jenkins instance.
Develop the "shared code" of the jenkins pipeline in a shared library   it can contains the whole pipeline (seq of steps) .
With every new launch I have to use cmd like:java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=8081(new port everytime) Note:I tried killing pid ports used earlier like 8080,8090,8081.
Any way I can get the data from the /jenkins_home to c:/jenkins_home?
I tried making a get call with axios from my Vue js codebase/ environment to Jenkins API and I 'm unable to do so.
Secondly, when the class is declared like in my previous example, the security plugin / jenkins sandbox will stop my pipeline if I 'm using "echo" or "println" in my class method.
Here in this example, I am actually trying to modify the string occurrence 'Memory Usage' with Jenkins build number .
I am using Jenkins to build periodically (15 minutes period).
But the problem is whenever jenkins start to build it takes unlimited time to finish although both of the containers are already started after a few minutes of starting to build.
For parameters defined in the pipeline Jenkins does not recognize them if the pipeline has not been executed at least once.
I have an environment variable in Jenkins and want to save the rest of the variable from the 4th character onwards into a new variable.
I believe that you cannot substitute Jenkins variables in single quote strings.
I have a Jmeter/Jenkins/maven/perforce framework for API testing purpose.Where each JMX contain around 200 test cases .each test cases are written inside a thread group with one user only.
If we ran the script from jmeter it ran smoothly but if we run the script from Jenkins say 20 jmx at a time sequentially,then after some time it may be 1 2 or 17 hr it fails showing out of memory error.
Is there a way to add column to DATABASECHANGELOG where I can store git branch from which the jenkins liquibase job is executed?
I 'm trying to generate Jenkins pipelines using the pipelineJob function in the jobDSL pluging, but cannot pass parameters from the DSL to the pipeline script.
I 've tried just about every combination of string interpretation that I can in the pipeline script, as well as in the DSL, but cannot get Jenkins/groovy to interpret variables in the pipeline script.
When i try to run tests in parallel using /code/ via terminal (or in Jenkins) on more than 2 iOS 13 simulators, the tests start crashing randomly.
/pre/  Note: If you had 3 jobs in your Jenkins instance named "demo", "demo1", and "example", then this script would delete "demo" AND "demo1" but not "example".
How can I trigger a script say A (in python) using Jenkins such that a shell script triggered internally from script A keeps running in background even after Jenkins build is done.
Right now, what I observe is that as soon as Jenkins job ends, it kills the background shell script too.
Is there a way that I can skip killing that background shell script from Jenkins?
A job contains the bash scripts (let 's call as /code/)  to init the global environments (/code/) and parse it to another bash scripts (/code/, which calling /code/ executor) to run it on Jenkins master/slave.
/pre/  The first loop will iterate over all Jenkins items and will store it under job var.
If the job is not a Jenkins Job the result can be null, so the /code/ check is there to allow the code to proceed only for Jenkins jobs.
I am new to Groovy DSL, I am getting a list of successful jenkins job names from a script which satisfies my condition which will vary on each execution, EX1: JOB_A,JOB_B.. EX2: JOB_C,JOB_Y...I need to trigger these result list of jobs at the time of execution of the script sequentially in a for loop from Script console using Groovy script.
I know how to write a Jenkins pipeline to execute a python code, which is convenient because you can define the container at job level: .
Since the Build status is not defined until the bBuild process has finished, you are unable to get one, but using Trigger Parameterised Build allows you to call a second Jenkins job and set a variable to True of False depending on Trigger when build is option.
Then in you other Jenkins job, you can receive those Variables as parameters and write a nice little Case of if statement to react accordingly, .
Jenkins seem to initiate a kernel process which consume CPU to max as seen in the snapshot.
Then you can add Jenkins queue job task in the pipeline, and verify the connection via this task: .
First, update your manual start or stop command inside a shell script and use the following line in your Jenkins pipeline script.
/pre/  Expected Result: The code should (1) create a docker service, (2) Spawn a docker container (3) Map the container 's /var/jenkins_home to /jenkins/ on host .
I want to access a jenkins secret string binding from inside a job dsl script.
If I have a secret string binding in Jenkins named "my-secret-string" how do I get the value of that in a dsl script?
The first part of my challenge is: What do I need to install on the Jenkins server (2) in order to build the complete solution?
Since Jenkins converts your Groovy script into Java, compiles it and then executes the result, it would be quite hard to use an external program to generate more Groovy to execute, since that additional groovy code would need to be converted.
/pre/  Another point is that this works inside a windows container with the version 1803, but unfortunately, I ca n't use that version because the Jenkins machine is using the last version of Windows (1903).
The code had jenkins_name instead of jenkins_home.
The only option I can see is to create a procedure that regularly does a /code/ and then iterates through the results, downloading them from the Artifactory Supermarket and then uploads all new versions to Chef Server via a shell script on a regular basis (cron job/jenkins).
Is there a way to limit IOPS on a docker container (in this case; my Jenkins container)?
In most cases &lt;JENKINS_SERVER_URL&gt;/scriptApproval should be enough.
Your local server stats, for instance, what if your jenkins CPU is 100% then can I expect constant installation time?
I tried to install Jenkins on Ubuntu server 18.04 and it shorten the time from 4.5 minutes to around 20 seconds for a full build with sub modules.
it showed 100+% CPU load for "jenkins" almost all the time when using the GUI.
memory use was at about 4GB, so I tried setting Jenkins JVM minimum heap size to 16GB and max to 22GB (host had 24GB) to ensure memory and GC was not an issue.
using YourKit Java profiler to profile the Jenkins JVM, while manually continuously accessing the GUI to cause the slowness effect.
After this the Jenkins performance improved to a good level.
Each time you run the job, Jenkins would check out your Jenkinsfile from the repo, and then run it.
I want to unit test some functions using pyspark and so I have to set up first Spark on a Jenkins instance.
I call my own tasks /code/ or /code/, depending on whether I 'm running tests on my local PC or the Jenkins server, and the respective task calls /code/.
I already did something similar with a Jenkins Multibranch project but ca n't use this approach this time as this is a special job that runs on all branches of a repo at once.
/pre/  I used the equivalent of this filter in the Jenkins testFilter parameter: .
I am very new to Jenkins so any pointers would be helpful!
/pre/  I see the coverage report in the jenkins UI for the one service so i thought I could wrap this in the same loop that executes like this .
I see a lot of people running maven builds multiple times through Jenkins on t2.micro instances... .
Have a Jenkins job that queries the source of truth and compares to the objects in the yaml file .
I have an installation of Jenkins on my windows 10 machine and I 'm trying to run the basic node.js pipeline example.
In a declarative Jenkins pipeline, I need to introduce a /code/ as another downstream for multiple upstream stages (B1, B2) which already have their corresponding downstream stages (C1,C2).
This entails running a Jenkins job and using Groovy  to call the Perf Center API.
I 'm trying to replace a keyword from a bash on jenkins groovy via pipeline, however the keyword I need to replace is also recognized as a variable .
/pre/  Jenkins is finally up and running on Java 11!
When this option non-zero, newly triggered builds of this project will be added to the queue, but Jenkins will wait for the specified period of time (in seconds) before actually starting the build.
This reduces the size of the queue, meaning that developers would get feedback faster for their series of commits, and the load on the Jenkins system would be reduced.
I know that a build had run for a Jenkins job (I received an e-mail with the results and the build number #9).
Jenkins just executes oc commands and proceeds to next stage execution.
Currently I 'm running a single Jenkins job for each of them with a Windows bash that looks roughly like:  .
Is it best practice to keep adding new Jenkins jobs for each single test case or is it better to run all tests in one job.
I have a job in Jenkins with a shell script that I want to save its output to a file and in the same time print to console, is that possible?
As suggested on this ticket (JENKINS-36544), we tried to set the environment variables in "System Configuration" for the dynamic ec2 slaves and set the environment variables for the other nodes on the "Node Configuration" overriding the "System Configuration", or so we thought.
We have a requirement to setup multiple jenkins instances on limited number of host machines.
I created a simple parameterized job in Jenkins and I input IP Address (eg 10.10.20.30) .
/pre/  So from git perspective only /code/ is executable which is also the case when I clone my repository on jenkins an try to execute the two scripts (only /code/ is getting executed).
Have 2 different execute shells in jenkins and need to pass a variable from one to another .
However, I 've been running into an error trying to using "Invoke-Command" or "New-PSSession" to a hyper-V Windows 10 VM in Jenkins Freestyle and Pipeline projects.
I 've also tried the same thing in a Jenkins installed in a Windows 10 machine instead of a windows server 2019 and everything works.
My main problem is the way Jenkins sends build steps to the running container.
After some evaluation I found out that the problem lies in the way Jenkins uses the container.
/pre/  But when you start the container in the background (as it is done in Jenkins), you ca n't call /code/ any more: .
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------- [ERROR] COMPILATION ERROR : [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------- [ERROR] /C:/Users/RISHAB/jenkins-demo/maven/MavenJenkinsDemo/src/main/java/com/rishab/sorting/EmployeeSorting.java:[30,43] lambda expressions are not supported in -source 1.5   (use -source 8 or higher to enable lambda expressions) .......... .
Environment variables are being set as I can do a /code/ and see all the parameters that are being set and the default Jenkins environment variables.
/pre/  I want Jenkins to execute "Stage_1", then execute Stage "Manual Input" only if the parameter "Input" is "Yes" or else skip the stage "Manual Input" and go to "Stage_3".
/pre/  do not work as well, because the Jenkins global vars files are not native Groovy code but processed.
I 'm trying to increment my pom version through Jenkins, but am facing many issues with the script element of the Jenkins declarative pipeline.
I have a number of jobs stored in a Jenkins folder that are run every few months.
/pre/  I want it to skip the stage in my Jenkins pipeline if it does not meet the conditions .
 You need to increase heap not for JMeter but for Jenkins, check out /url/ article for instructions.

My Jenkins job fails if I try to deploy a list of lambdas and then try to deploy a secondary list of lambdas.
/pre/  This process is to allow the Jenkins consumer to choose whether to deploy a single lambda or a group of lambdas based on the folder structure of the Lambda.
The expected behavior should be that a user can kick off the Jenkins job and deploy the Lambdas in group A and then proceed to trigger the job again to deploy the Lambdas in group B with no issues.

Jenkins job (output variable name) shows me what is the name of the endpoint.if some one wants to consume this sos queue at the application level how do I pass this variable which is output.tf to the application that wants to consume it dynamically , do I write a shell script to go fetch the contents from s3 tfvars file ?
But I 'm not relishing the idea of running an rsync server in Jenkins (which is n't the most secure platform at the best of times).
I 'm running a freestyle jenkins job which executes cucumber test cases on a windows slave machine.
The actual execution completed in 17:23 mins but the jenkins job takes overall 42 mins to finish.
Change your Jenkins job to pick up the variables from the location you chose in step 2. .
Now i want that when I click on Jenkins Job run to execute tests, my tests should run in a docker container.
Currently, your Jenkins job looks like this (it does n't really matter whether its an "old-school" job "step-by-step" definition or groovy script (pipelines): .
Now when the image is ready the integration with Jenkins might be as simple as running a /code/ command and wait till it 's done.
In my case, Jenkins job name and also svn branch name were longer (About 40 characters).
basically if I try oneliner in Jenkins, it often does n't work: .
However, when I add it to jenkins the script always fails in first run and only pass in second run.
The best practice is sticking to /url/ principle, to wit instead of having multiple Jenkins jobs you can come up with a single /url/ and pass new .jmx script and .jtl file names as the job parameters.
In theory test should run with features alphabetical order, at local machine it 's exactly like that, but in Jenkins order is not alphabetical.
As Jeyan said the Jenkins variables only available for System groovy scripts and not for plain groovy script and that is the reason that I could not load Jenkins instances from plain groovy script.
/code/ will not work because Jenkins run the command as a script, you have to option  .
I have already tried Increasing Heap space pf Jenkins server to 25 GB out of 32 GB.It seems Initially it takes 1 Gb then after some times it throws the error even though it still have 24 GB pf memory available in heap ,I ran free -h for this.
Due to this, running tox takes 2 seconds locally but 90 seconds in Jenkins.
In order to update the dashboard, first the latest build number must be obtained through Jenkins as the build number is updated periodically.
In addition Jenkins does n't respect /code/ environment variable, it uses /code/ and/or /code/ instead.
the Jenkins job triggers the above main method and runs SomeClassTest few times, .
I need to get the result for each run of SomeClassTest  in Jenkins job .
Jenkins itself will consume one quoting backslash, so you need to double them, e.g.
I am using jenkins for a job and I want to execute a command as root in execute shell but when I run  sudo su  and then whoami I get the result ubuntu.
I 'm trying to launch a python command line application from jenkins pipeline in shell command , but my build fails since one of the arguments uses pipe(|) symbol and pipeline interprets and adds single quotes to the command.
Below is my pipeline where I 'm passing TAGS  as jenkins build parameters where value is given as "test1|test2" .
I want to make a testing stage in Jenkins, but the when condition does n't work with the environment variable set in the stage directly.
/pre/  Whereas /code/ is a jenkins pipeline definition which uses the /code/ class like .
I am really new to Jenkins and Python so when I have initially researched for this problem, there has been a limit to my understanding.
It works fine using the Python interpreter on my local machine but I have had issues when I have tried using the Jenkins Python script builder and so I am looking for a way around this.
Indexing of different sourcetypes such as .xml to Splunk from Jenkins is not possible, but indexing key:value pair in format of .csv or .json is possible again with its own limitations.
Solution: There needs to be conversion scripts in jenkins side to convert all the non key:value pairs to key:value pair.
Perhaps this solution is a little bit cumbersome, but pipelines do n't offer any other way to achieve the same functionality as "Execute Groovy Script" stuff from the old Jenkins, because the plugin /url/ is not supported yet for pipeline.
Stolen from /url/ answer, you need to set the PYTHONENCODING environment variable on your Jenkins server.
Apparently, it can either be done in the Jenkins management console or, prior to calling your python validation script, you can execute this in the shell: .
But from what I understand, when Jenkins gets to the agent line, it 'll pick any of my machines that provide Edge and Python, so there 's no guarantee that the last parts of my pipeline will work, since it might pick an entirely different machine to run the later commands on.
I decided to load a local instance of Jenkins on my Win 10 Laptop.
I want to run two docker container in declarative Jenkins pipeline, because I have container with backend which utilises Selenium server container for test.
In jenkins "Stream Codeline" has the value which I need.
For instance I required P4CLIENT environmental variable, set to a particular format, so using the predefined variables in jenkins I achieved it.
Typically Jenkins jobs are done when whatever process is complete.
my goal would be to be able to have a script that will infinetly run, and will be terminated by Jenkins at a certain time.
You can obtain the Jenkins build number using the requests and json module in your Python script.
I am trying to create folder and jobs in Jenkins using groovy.In the process of  learning groovy I came across below function.What does below folder function do in groovy script?
Using /code/ in the Jenkins file drops the time needed from 90 seconds to 20.
But finally scripts has to run on Linux node through Jenkins and I do n't have access of those nodes.

I 've set up a jenkins job to deploy my code at regular intervals of time.
I found the way to stop Jenkins build with a success on first step which fetches new code.
I have the below groovy script designed to get me the total no of builds that have been triggered on each job, now i want to restrict it to just fetch the jobs that have been executed in duration of last 24 hrs also if i run this script on jenkins server when a build is running it return an exception as mentioned below  .
Your repos is only going to take a few seconds to clone in your current setup, I 'd wager, and your time is worth way more than jenkins 's.
changing the port to 8081) will work - until I restart Jenkins again, this time 8081 will be in use (and also 8080 and all other ports I 've been using before).
I 'm trying to automate the process of analyzing Jenkins result for the job executed.
Currently, we have a Single Jenkins Instance on a VM that also runs the Selenium Grid.
/pre/  Jenkins is running on Windows 10 machine.
When i am passing value of a variable declared in jenkins Groovy script its value is not retained in for loop which is running on a remote server.
To execute test cases created from  cucumber + selenium web-driver can use Jenkins as test execution environment.
/pre/  "sleep 60" above allows the tomcat to start before Jenkins tries to deploy to it.
Which means that you can start launch at ReportPortal (as a part of you test runner or as a Jenkins pre-step + /code/ request).
If significant changes were found, Jenkins prints difference statistics (real example): .
Jenkins in configuration promises variable of type /code/, but in fact provides type /code/ with values are /code/ or /code/ which are always evaluated as /code/ when used as condition since both values are not empty strings :).
I have this array called commitInfoAll in my Jenkins pipeline,  I 'm trying to get only the commit hashes from this array into another list/array.
I 'm using Nexus OSS 3.19.0-01 artifactory and Jenkins 2.910.1 .
I have a Jenkins Free Style job, where I need to pass a string Parameter.The parameter is slack Token .
I also tried following /url/ but still no luck (cannot run neither from command line nor on Jenkins) .
Jenkins container cannot ping Docker containers even though I use the same network in both docker-compose files.
As a result, I cannot ping the Node/Mongo containers from the Jenkins container (so I guess no SSH either).
I have a bash script:start_jenkins.sh which starts a java process.

When I use nodeSelector ("jenkins=slave") for podTemplate, kubernetes always schedule new pod on same node  regardless the amount of started Jenkins jobs.
In this case, D:\Jenkins and then I executed: .
However same groovy script runs fine outside of Jenkins.
When I try checking kubectl version (also within jenkins pipeline), here 's the output: .
For example a shell-script can then tell jenkins to start a new stage from the running script.
How Jenkins handles the scripts and starts the steps, but It seems as though every step is directly called through the method name after the script is parsed, and I found no way to hook into this.
And for that jenkins build process took infinity time to complete the complete the build.
Is there a way to set the environment variable on Ubuntu and have Jenkins pass it through to Docker?
I have a jenkins pipeline that gets arguments that will affect a the args for a python script I want to run: .
Note that I first ran my jenkins.war on port 9090.
I 'm setting up a CD pipeline in Jenkins and I want to run my unit tests and integration tests in two different steps.
I do n't know exactly what is Jenkins "build with parameter" but in Azure DevOps you have an option of Variables and determine the values when you queue the build: .
Jenkins use previous build to determine the next build number, if build number you input is lower than previous build number, Jenkins will automatically increase your build number to higher than previous build.
/pre/  In this example, the pod name is "jenkins-2-7d6d7fd99c-9xgkx" for ip address "10.2.6.181".
We set up Jenkins running on our mac at address 10.20.xx.xx:8080  .

/pre/  Now I want to use the version returned from ps script in a Jenkins file: .
This sounds like my never-ending battle with Jenkins test execution vs. local test execution.
Alternatively, refer to /url/, you could invoke a batch file with Jenkins like this for Windows paths: .
Every time you run your job, those new allure results files will be generated in the Jenkins workspace.
Jenkins is deleting workspaces on slave machines after 30 days or 30th day of month.
I want to simply call a batch script that trigger my jenkins server to start a build under some conditions.
I am confused about whether a Jenkins job can be run using Groovy script in the slave node.
Since I am trying through Groovy script I am unable to access few Jenkins instances.
Forgive me if i 'm slightly off in some of my vocab, this is my first time writing a Jenkins plugin.

I 'm trying to create a pipeline in Jenkins, where the first stage may or may not generate files to be stashed for later.
I want to write a variable in bashrc file with help of jenkins if the variable does n't exist.
We have a conditional Jenkins pipeline script where stages are executed or skipped depending on parameters.
Hi I a using jenkins execute shell to take checkout from a branch and then scp the code into another server.This is what I have in my execute shell .
I have a jenkins pipeline build that rarely (maybe 1 in 20) times hangs and then times out.
After downloading the files ( 17 GB ) the to node locally I 'm facing an issue with how to share those files with all the other nodes, at first, I 've tried to parallel-rsync all the files to the other nodes but its took a lot of time on with python multithreading  ( 24 nodes ) and then I 've tried to use parallel-ssh in order to tell each node to download the files its self but it also took a lot of time, then i thought about triggering lots of jobs from Jenkins buts its may fill up my queue.
I have two Jenkins that are located on a different instances, I want to trigger Job 'A' on Jenkins 'A', after a job 'B' finished running and succeeded on Jenkins 'B'.
/pre/  You can have a condition if Jenkins "B" job is successfully run the above API.
In the long run you should consider running Jenkins workloads on slaves.
Because in worst case denser workloads can kill your Jenkins master.
SSH Gradle commands are being sent to Windows 10 OpenSSH from Jenkins Server to start UI Functional Tests (AssertJ - Java Swing Application).
In My Job Jenkins I have parameter "browser" type choice, where I have as values: (Chrome, Firefox) When I want to run job, I have an option select parameter.
I got empty String in variable /code/ when trying to extract a substring /code/ from string: Loaded image: /code/ by /code/ in Jenkins execute shell: .
I want to trigger a build in Jenkins B by running build in Jenkins A, I know that I can use a Curl command from Jenkins A but actually I could n't figure it how and where to write the command, inside the pipeline or as power-shell script?
In jenkins configuration what I need to do, so that I can call the mentioned function in my Jenkinsfile.
Set up a job in Jenkins that executes your build script and calls NUnit 's console runner, which takes a /code/ as a parameter.
I need to start a downstream job in jenkins when the current job fails N number (say 3) times in a row.
This is to provide cost effective solution to the spawn on demand jmeter(Not containerization )instance using Jenkins.
The nodes I have in Jenkins are Windows machines.
I set up one Jenkins job to run two Fitnesse tests at the build section: .
In my case winniumdriver process is still on, thats the reason jenkins is not moving to next stage.
I have a Jenkins Groovy script that runs a JDBC query with the intention of outputting the result to a CSV file.
I have over 20 Cucumber features, when I execute test on my computer - test are running with alphabetic order, but when I execute test in remote Jenkins, order is always the same, but not in alphabetical order.
Do you know how execution order in jenkins is set?
There may be very limited benefit to this, you will have multiple replicas of the /code/ all running on the same node, so it depends on how the Jenkins process scales and if it can support that type of scale horizontal out model while all writing to the same volume (as opposed to simply vertically scaling memory or CPU requests).
Currently my jenkins pod is running on just one node.
Because pasting raw pipeline definitions are very ugly especially that we have to escape every Jenkins pipeline variable.
/pre/  I use this code (part of a Jenkinsfile) twice: Once on a Windows Slave and once on a Linux Slave of Jenkins.
I am trying to get the build number of Jenkins and display it later as front-end version number in footer.
Since I am using a Deployment and my PVC in /code/, I am basically stuck with one pod, running jenkins, on one node.
/code/ this is offical Jenkins image which is just 160MB and the size of base image is just 5MB.
This should probably be fixed in their jenkins plugin itself but as "Christopher Orr" suggested mapping environment vars at the pipeline stage level to the same ones set in the container work .
Is it possible to have a Jenkins pipeline which calls multiple Powershell script files for different taks, can i pass values from task 1 to take 2 etc ?
I want to know the best way to proceed, examples of calling Ps script files and returning values into Jenkins variables would be good, either caling a PS file or running Powershell code directly.
However, you can trigger a scan as part of your Jenkins job.
Actually, I believe your first idea for a solution can be achieved easily with docker and without the need to run any Jenkins slave as root.
what I want is, to run my test files with Jenkins after that put my scripts into a container to work everywhere.
I would like to run my tests against a Docker MongoDB instance using Jenkins pipeline.
For example, if the git commit says "Version 1.0.0" then the variable in the Jenkins file should be "1.0.0".
I know it is possible to run jenkins job from pipeline like this  .
Is there any way to tell anchore plugin in Jenkins to scan "OS" or "ALL" specifically?
If you are using single quotes(```) in the shell module, Jenkins treats every variable as a bash variable.
During a jenkins pipeline, when there is an input step that waits for user input, the pipeline cannot be advanced or aborted from the console output.
I have tried to running the Jenkins slave-agent as a windows service and also tried starting it with a batch script running at startup but I get the same result.
I have defined global variable in Jenkins pipeline .
/pre/  We run jenkins nodes on ecs so the daemon does n't seem to buy us much.

I have a powershell script that runs on a Jenkins node and calls some commands that execute on separate servers.
I am running Jenkins jobs to create a Azure instance and that will run terraform script to do this task.The terraform script will create NIC first and later it will create VM.Sometimes the NIC creation is taking too long in Azure environment and Vm creation steps are getting  executed before NIC fully created.Is there any way so that Script should go to next step only when NIC creation is done fully.Can someone help?
Running with the daemon, even on a single use jenkins ECS based node improves performance.
I am trying to run a python3 script within a shell script (that is called by jenkins' build function).
I want to run a command in Jenkins pipeline, n times based on the array list that I have.
One way I thought of was an http request to the jenkins web API, but that seems a bit convoluted, and specifically, I had some problems doing that in the past.
Now I would like to set up a jenkins job which executes these queries automatically.
/pre/  You can decentralize all your functions with the Jenkins Shared Libraries.
I have set of commands which I am trying to run in a " Execute windows batch command" in Jenkins.
/pre/  step 3 - create a docker container (ie jenkins), that will default to localhost, and expose the port on something other than 80, ie 81.
Declare a different system temporary directory in the script that starts Jenkins (whether /etc/init.d or Windows or shell script): /code/ .
As better explained in the jenkins docs for /url/, when injecting a usernamePassword type credential into an environment variable named VAR_NAME, jenkins automatically generates two other variables ending with _USR and _PSW respectively for usernameVariable and passwordVariable parameters.
or fetch to Jenkins job workspace in order to test?
First thing, Jenkins listen on default port /code/ not /code/.
However, when they 're executed on Jenkins by using /code/ command, the tests that reference the 32-bit assembly fail with BadImageFormatException: .
When I forced it to use 64-bit (Unit Test Sessions —> Options —> Platform —> x64), a few tests failed with same message as on Jenkins.
Specific test shall brake at the first failure using environment variable (as an choice parameter in Jenkins).
Start a task in ECS with a jenkins master server, and then start 1 or 2 agents when you go to execute a job is not a good tactic neither practical idea, who going to wake up these tasks?
If you want to use a jenkins docker inside an EC2 instance and you have a master node running and you want to keep stopped your unused agents and start it only if is needed by a job maybe in your Jenkinsfile you can call a lambda function to start your agent, here and example in a Jenkinsfile: .
In my experience run Jenkins directly in EC2 is a better choice that run it in ECS or Fargate.
Is there a way to pass in these Jenkins input parameters to this script?
/pre/  Also, double-check the Jenkins execute shell, is it passing the variable and docker able to expend these variables from Jenkins params.
one last thing, double-check the value in script instead of Jenkins UI.
It does work when I try the exact same command (robot RobotFramework/test.robot) on a new Docker container using the same image or when I pause the container in the Jenkins pipeline and execute the exact same command on the running container .
The string variable /code/ is injected by Jenkins in the environment when a build starts and is interpolated by the pipeline Groovy script in runtime.
In every CI solutions, it 's possible to pause a pipeline and wait to a manual approval to continue (Jenkins, CircleCI, GitlabCI).
In Scripted Pipelines, Jenkins by default may not necessarily checkout the repository in the same node where you run your stage.
I would like to trigger a Jenkins job when there is bit bucket master branch merge only.
The path to the /code/ binary is probably not in your /code/ variable in the context that Jenkins is started in.
I created Jenkins Server instance and tried to call getJenkinVersion() and getJobs() method and both works well  and returns results as expected.
One suggestion is that you run something like 'echo whoami' in your jenkins script to make sure you are your current user.
What should I do to make Jenkins work on my Windows 10 local machine?
Since you are using Jenkins, you can get the current build number and commit-id and many other variables in Jenkinsfile itself as Jenkins injects these values at builds runtime.
For me the following worked on Jenkins 2.190.1 and was much simpler than some of the other workarounds: .
Jenkins.instance.items gives me a list of all items present in that Jenkins instance (in my case it would be the master node).
where node will be one of Jenkins.instance.nodes .
Jenkins will not see the location that points at the script I 'm trying to execute.
I am trying to call a method of the groovy script from Jenkins pipeline script and in that, I am getting  java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot invoke method getBuildsByDomain() on null object.
First with the assumption, your second job is common for all the branches, you can have a Jenkins file in each branch which triggers the common job (based on another jenkins file which is in a common location) in it.
Second, if the functionality is different for each branch, what I would suggest is come up with a generic functions and try passing parameters based on the requirement of each branch in the first Jenkins file.
I 'm trying to compare two strings in Jenkins pipeline.
I have a jenkin job name called A. I want this to run in parallel on different nodes in jenkins pipeline.
I suppose that jenkins nodes do not possess items as such - all the "items", which in your case I believe to be hudson.model.TopLevelItem, exist on master instance, thus nodes do not hold information what they do have.
I have s solution in VS2015 of C# that actually is a collection of several solutions, until today my Jenkins file called to several solutions that in most case contains the same low levels projects and i wanted to collect all what needs to be compiled in one solution in order to save time.
You would probably return whenever its not the default branch (whatever you have set in jenkins) .
I know the container ID of the container where I wish to run some jenkins steps.
There are different types of events which can be added for a Jenkins Job, so in your case you have to do:- .
Does anyone have any idea what other things we can do in order to send the address of aws in my local container to jenkins image that I am trying to run in docker container?
I 'm trying to use an env var in Jenkins' pipeline /code/ block, but it seems they are n't extrapolated at that stage.
You can use the Test Result Analyzer plugin from Jenkins to analyse the trends of tests.
No known implementation of interface jenkins.tasks.SimpleBuildStep is named ExportParametersBuilder .
There is no need to have a running Jenkins instance.
Suppose for example, If USERNAME is one of the String parameters that you use to build the jenkins job, then the same can be accessed in a JAVA Class by using the below code.
Is there any options to lock TFS check-ins when the build is failing or three consequent times in Jenkins?
In the Jenkins Job I sent two parameters (that was fit to the previous structure) like that: .
Jenkins declarative pipeline: I want to run 2 or 3 stages on the same agent in parallel.
The problem is that if I set the agent to have 1 executor, Jenkins wo n't run them at the same time.
Solution: In order to always continue failed steps in your jenkins pipeline:  .
/pre/  Option 2. run your jenkins pipeline in parallel and set /code/ configuration property in your step.
I 've seen in particular that Python Requests works over Mocks, but I have to say, I 'm not sure this is the right way to write tests and include them in a Jenkins pipeline.
All this needs to be done through a Jenkins job running on a Linux node.
When the Jenkins slave run as service in the background every program it initiate, like running the batch file, will also be in the background.
The solution is to run the Jenkins slave as a regular program in the foreground.
I 'm looking for a way to use Jenkins to build a single code base for multiple CPU architectures.
The ideal situation would be to run the build over a number of different jenkins slaves with a different CPU architectures.
i am new to Jenkins, my task is to schedule Jenkins job by using requests module.Is there any way to do this.
In Jenkins we can schedule our tests/builds in whichever way(every minute/hour/day/month.....) or based on the commits etc.. .
There is a jenkins plugin "Performance" which can be used to check the response time for each API call, which compares the response time with respect to the previous response times.
In order to Pass groovy parameters into bash scripts in Jenkins pipelines (causing sometimes bad substitions) You got 2 options: .
Easy hack to solve this was indeed adding a .bat file that was run from the Jenkins(Execute windows batch command).
For some task, I need to get build logs from jenkins in real time.
I have an "item" in jenkins, there are several steps: - execute win batch - execute groovy script .
I am trying to automatically kick off a jenkins build through my node lambda.
how to run integration test classes on priority that is in sequence  using Jenkins.
you can see it in jenkins code: scroll down to method:  .
I want to send few parameters to one of my shell scripts written in linux server from a jenkins job.
I tried few ways as follows but not coping with requirement :  - Since I have argument to pass to remote server command to run which /code/  does n't supports it   - /code/ displays my execCommand in the jenkins logs which I dont want too.
Jenkins interprets a pipeline as failed if a command returns an exit code unequal zero.
In order to test our jenkins shared library code we wrote >300 tests.
Depending on the number of files Jenkins is showing artifacts either as plain list (16 or less files), foldout tree (40 or less files) or as simple link (more than 40 files).
Then i run a Selenium-test also through Jenkins and a batch file.
Doing it manually is not an option since JMeter is running on a remote node through Jenkins.
I have Ubuntu 18.04 with Jenkins 2.190.1 installed and try to run the simple pipeline script .
I am created one Jenkins pipeline job and added every step in my Jenkinsfile.
I write Jenkins pipeline which in the end will trigger execution of java process on remote host.
I am running my test cases though jenkins which are on my local branch.
Is there any way to get jenkins to run the latest code everytime?
I already defined global environment variables /code/, /code/ and /code/ in jenkins but it did n't change anything.
In order to Pass groovy parameters into bash scripts in Jenkins pipelines -  Use this post /url/ .
This happens only in Jenkins, only after the addition of a new Copy task: .
Although it happens in Jenkins, Jenkins is invoking Gradle via a gradle command in a "Execute windows batch script" - so I do not believe there is any mixing of the Jenkins and Gradle JVMs - though certainly some Jenkins environment variables may trigger the difference.
And in the Job configuration, you can have regular expression matching to your actual branches, so that Jenkins will ignore the remaining branches.
How to run java integration test classes sequentially on priority basis in Jenkins?
/pre/  This job runs the stages in parallel with the following Jenkins code.
/pre/  Once the Jenkins SSH thread exits after one minute, my python app keeps running on the remote machine.
If I start python /home/foo/app.py directly inside the remote-exec block rather than invoking start_app.sh, then TF never exits the shell and my Jenkins build keeps spinning forever.
Each class is a testfixture (NUnit) and in Jenkins, I want to run class A (first class) then run a powershell command, then run Class B (also a testfixture).
Right now we are trying to integrate Browserstack into our testing pipeline, and I noticed that exucution time on Browserstack is dramatically slower than when I run it locally, or on Jenkins.
First listener rule points to 8080 port on path /jenkins/ to the ec2 instance .
You will need, however, approve using /code/ method when you run it for the first time in the Jenkins Pipeline.
/pre/  Right now i use "gradlew test" to run my tests from jenkins.
What is the shortcut for commenting out multiple lines at one time in Jenkins file?
However, my Jenkins integration server that runs the unit tests runs with a heap space set to 4GB.
If your Jenkins job has the need to execute Docker build/run commands (e.g., to build a container), this is not sufficient.
Suppose, I run one Jenkins job from another like - .
I am using junit through jenkins to execute my test-cases and display execution report.
My jenkins workspace is executing on node so shell commends wont work in this.
I will upload this in a jenkins job where there are running other 3rd party softwares that return Lastexitcode which Powershell does n't recognize them so I need a function with regex to find in what is written so far and terminate upon finding it.
How can I make a slack command trigger a Jenkins job at a specific time  .
I just added one /code/ condition in deployment stage and accessing the created Jenkins environment variable.
I am trying to stop my jenkins job [JOB_A] between 6PM to 9PM because it is running complete day after every 3 min and between 6-9 PM there is an another job [JOB_B] to run and both jobs can create conflict.
I have a number of reusable steps defined in my Jenkins shared library.
Does Jenkins provide any variable or something?
You can trivially include two tests in your Jenkins job to rule out these options.
I do not know any way of escaping or quoting to keep a white space character that is part of the value of a parameter for a Jenkins job when using jenkins-cli.jar .
The Jenkins master handles white space, backslashes and quotes on the command line somewhat like a shell: .
I noticed very high CPU usage on my Jenkins Master(v2.202) , sometimes over 700%.
Now while running test project in jenkins job , i want to capture code coverage report for main source code.
Yes, my first solution proposal works in a Jenkins pipeline.
I would like to read the revision number from Jenkins job when the job fails .
I now have to integrate these tests in Jenkins which I assumed would be straight forward; however, this is not the case.
After creating a job in Jenkins I executed the "mvn test" command to run my tests and maven does run the test but the test will always fail because Sikuli cannot find the image on the screen.
For instance, I run successfully your second example in my Jenkins Pipeline.
I have a Jenkins instance in a private subnet with a load balancer in front of it, also in a private subnet.
i have a jenkins pipeline file, this stage is executed on a windows node (the master is on a container running on Mac).
I have the following pipeline that is executed on a Windows 10 Jenkins slave with Windows docker installed.
Assume I want to wrap a command in a Jenkins stage between an unstash and stash command, e.g.
In my specific case I use jenkins job that calls a shell-script which connects to the beanshell-service running on the local-host: .
In addition, it seems you run Jenkins in the container instance.
The API key needed for the REST call is stored as Secret Text in our Jenkins instance.
There is much more elegant /code/ method for Groovy, but it may only work in Jenkins pipelines.
(the "fetch" size in my comparison is the size of the directory which I measured with "du -ms" at the moment after "git fetch" and before "git checkout" when it was done with the help of Jenkins pipeline) .
This is exactly answer to your question why do n't you see big difference between shallow and full clone for Jenkins pipeline: because Jenkins pipeline uses "fetch+checkout" approach which in case of --depth works differently than "clone" and downloads more data than "clone".
In Jenkins, I want to be able to delay the execution of a job, i.e.
jenkins-2018-04-11_cve-2018-1000169 .
jenkins-2018-04-11_cve-2018-1000170 .
I am taking parameter value from Jenkins.
this function is not a part of the jenkins pipeline.
/pre/    where below /code/ list was prepared at the time of jenkins 1.642.1 version: .
/pre/  I did mention /code/ triple double quotes to accept the parameters from the jenkins, and did /code/, but it would still print the command in the console.
Before: This way the tests runs locally, but do not works in the jenkins pipeline (npm run test) .
I suspected that it could be due to the different interpreter that Jenkins might use to run commands, so I tried running it with /code/, however it yielded no results.
All i need to invoke through my jenkins declarative pipeline is the value of that kubectl command that i can use later in my script.
Jenkins >= 1.520 (1.532.1 for LTS) requires Java 6 thus Maven jobs    must be launched with a JDK >= 6. .
Jenkins >= 1.612 (1.625.1 for LTS) requires Java 7 thus Maven jobs    must be launched with a JDK >= 7. .
Jenkins >= 2.54 (2.60.1 for LTS) requires Java 8 thus Maven jobs must    be launched with a JDK >= 8. .
I am trying to run a simple shell script using jenkins to exec into a pod and execute ls -las in the root directory but its not allowing to exec into the pod automatically.
Before: This way the tests runs locally, but do not works in the jenkins pipeline (npm run test) .
As you said, you are using jenkins:2.190.2 but your plugins list is from: jenkins:1.647 (2016/02/04).
I have a jenkins pipeline script that runs various test suites in parallel over multiple nodes.
The below code is being used to trigger a shell command using Jenkins file.
So in any case you have to create two jenkins pipelines 1st to build your library, 2nd one to build your microservice.
/pre/  The intension was to run this java code test case in Jenkins build action execute shell (Unix) using a headless browser.
My question is, if it is possible to stop the CI (stop the jenkins pipeline build), if the quality check is not passed.
For setting up a CI pipeline with Jenkins it is a requirement that gradlew test runs all tests in the same way my IDE (IntelliJ) so far has.
I am trying to save a variable after jenkins job completes.
i am trying to get value of variable by given string: Running this code on Jenkins  and its get "bad substitution" in regular shell it works.
i have to achieve this batch script condition in jenkins if not exist z:\ (net use z: \path...........) .
The plugin it self allows you to run python scripts that you write in Jenkins, I have tried things like ${}  $Var .
I have created two jobs, virtually identical jobs in our Jenkins server.
/pre/    Would like to launch this jenkins container on single instance ECS cluster.
I finally just dumped Jenkins all together and set up a Windows Task Manager to have the Robot Framework test case run from there instead.
i have jenkins instance with about 150 jobs.
I always use this command as the first step in my Jenkins jobs for login to ECR: .
)Jenkins is not able to run the next command.
I always have to start the webdriver manager through npm and then run my test cases through jenkins in order to do it thorugh jenkins.
I was thinking I could have a microservice in the Azure Functions to monitor the bucket and trigger Jenkins but it would be great if I could do this directly without an additional microservice.
Setup my first pipeline using Jenkin 's Ocean Blue on a EC2 RHEL 8 instance and when attempting to run docker commands (such as as docker pull maven:3.6.2-jdk-14) as the jenkins user the following error is always returned No subuid ranges found for user "jenkins" in /etc/subuid .
On your Jenkins job has executed, you can review its environment variables (on the left side of the job execution instance page) .
I use a heredoc block in my build step 'execute shell' on Jenkins: .
/pre/  My test passes locally with expected hour 00 and actual hour 00 but when I deploy through Jenkins the actual hour is showing as 23 and my expected is 00.  .
I 'll demonstrate it with short example: On this example I 'll store an api token of my app in Jenkins credentials ,get it in my pipeline step and curl it to perform some rest api HTTP operation on my server.
I am new to Jenkins and bit-bucket, my task is to push a code to bit-bucket and the same code should run in Jenkins.
i am successfully push the code to bit-bucket but the code which i pushed to bit-bucket is not executing in Jenkins.
I 'm a member of a group that is a member of a group that is a member of IA-EC-DEV and thus should be able to log into Jenkins), Active Directory has a special rule matching OID that handles ancestry.
python-jenkins (0.4.13) .
When i run them on Jenkins the build takes between 3 minutes to 15 minutes and then it fails with a timeout rendering issue usually.
This works fine as expected means: When i commit in this branch it triggers Jenkins multi branch pipeline.
But when for the first time a new branch is created, that time also vsts (devops-azure) pipeline is triggered which tries to trigger Jenkins multi branch pipeline but till that time Jenkins job is not being created so it gives me below error.
Would like to know if there is any possible to keep pool of containers running always as jenkins agents in ECS cluster and scale up on-demand when there is load .
I can use same label to run jenkins job , but this is going to spin up container , execute job and kill the the ECS task for every execution which causes increasing build time .
Create a string variable in jenkins and then use str.split() in the python script to make a list.
