With Jenkins Pipelines, you need to be careful about the quote escaping that is provided.
I have created new Jenkins Job (Freestyle project) and my project repository has only few text files.
The way Jenkins works is it creates its own workspace for each job, essentially to sandbox the environment, its a testing framework so it should be used to stage changes to code, which will then be pushed to your live(working) environment.
People use it to automate some tasks, but this isnt the primary use of Jenkins.. if the above does n't help you let me know more details of the error and I can try help you with it.

Go through recently made changes that can be the cause of such behavior, for example, new plugins, changes to config files (jenkins.xml)?
Also worth mentioning, as a simple dirty trick, I found that if you specify your Jenkins server 's base URL (in your web browser) with the appropriate webhook appendage - e.g.
If you share you config details of webhook and Jenkins additional info can be provided.
I 'm unable to find jenkins config files like config.xml, jenkins.xml etc.
New Job from the Manage Jenkins section is self explanatory   Most of the older tutorials are accurate in that you need some plugins Github, Keychains and Provisioning Profiles Management (still not 100% that you need this plugin though but still good to have and set it up) and others I downloaded and installed but never used including I did not use the Xcode plugin in the Build section of the Job setup.
I installed Jenkins on my own machine and found the solution I was hoping for, so I 'll answer my own question in case any beginner out there has the same technical needs: .
I 've read the help in Jenkins itself and also /url/.
A Jenkins job is defined by XML, displaying a new parameter based on a value of another one means that the XML definition of the job should be changed and the job reloaded again.

If your porpouse is a plataform, to conduct the job, see scheduling options, command line, version control, integration with jenkins and others you will need the enterprise subscription version of Talend, that has TAC ( Talend Administration Center).
For me, the solution was to go to Manage Jenkins -> Global Tool Configuration, and set up maven there.
There does n't seem to be a setting on a Gitlab side for that: Gitlab -> Project -> Settings -> Jenkins CI Integrations to set up a webhook for some other branch, like "dev" f.e.
Is the anyway to make a Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline better support incremental builds by preferring the last build node when it build a branch instead of choosing an available node more or less randomly?
We are setting up a Jenkins multibranch pipeline for a large Git project, where we use Make to build and test a lot of code.
For this to work, Jenkins have to pick the same workspace for changes to the same branch again.

I 'm currently using Android Lint Plugin in Jenkins to show the results of the lint checks.
(Unfortunately I ca n't change submodules configs) (Unfortunately I ca n't change Jenkins) .
One option is definitely that, you could have the BOM project build first using a separate job in Jenkins and that way when you build your main Parent project it finds that dependency.
I have created new jenkins job, in which I want to execute a Jenkins file from a particular folder.
In the Jenkins documentation, they are only given this syntax and does n't mentioned about anything else.
I 'm using a multi-branch job in Jenkins and the folders that are auto-generated are extremely long!
Be sure to check mark the /code/ checkbox under /code/ for your Jenkins job 's configuration.
I have certain issues integrating my old version of Gitlab with Pipeline Jobs in Jenkins and came upon such a workaround.
I have created a new job in jenkins (freestyle job) .
When I am creating another Jenkins job to promote a build from 1 repo to other then it is asking build name and build number and I do n't know from where I have to get the build name and build number.
I was hoping that I could supply the absolute path to the Jenkins SSH job but that did n't work -- apparently, its scope of accessibility is the particular build 's workspace.
Question: How can I specify the parameter in GenerateFiles where to dump the files in ${JENKINS_WORKSPACE}/${THIS_BUILD} so that SendFilesOver can copy it from there (using "Copy artifacts from another project") to its own workspace so that it can SCP it over to the destination?
Official Jenkins documentation /url/ .
but it works on jenkins only.
Longer term when this project is fleshed out we will write our own service to listen for the TFS Generic Web Hook request and then get a crumb followed by sending a formal HTTP Post to the Generic Web Hook Plugins default url it listens to (with Jenkins' CSRF enabled).
First of all jenkins whichever files are picking up, all are workspace related.
To load a jenkins file from a custom location, you have to do like this by adding this line to the script.
I am new to jenkins so i do n't know in depth about it.
But i read that in jenkins only projects created in maven are accepted but not any other.
I do n't know whether this question is quite suitable to ask or not but we have less time and i am completely new to jenkins.Any suggestions or answers will be valuable to me .
Since I have already configured my Git repo with Jenkins, this workspace will also update accordingly.
I am using Jenkins 2.89.2 and my project has /code/ which defines all build pipeline and steps.
But in my jenkins configuration page I could n't find this options.
Please see the related issue in the jenkins tracker /url/ .
Using Blue ocean plugin a Jenkins file is created and used to run the job.
The settings of the email plugin and jenkins file is attached.
I not seen the link you provided but looks this is some kind of Jenkins job.
/pre/  PS: your title should be "how to know which git repository and triggered the jenkins job".
/pre/  I am very new to Groovy and Jenkins so if its syntax issue or if I 'm missing a step please let me know.
You can read more of usage in official doc of Jenkins here - /url/ .
I ended up just doing a sed command on all the xml files in /var/lib/jenkins/jobs and replace the credentials id with the new id.
Whenever I create a new job on Jenkins, it creates 2 workspaces on the perforce server.
I am automatically adding a GitHub Organization to my Jenkins instance when it starts up, but when it adds each job it executes it.
If you need to change the Jenkins home directory in Ubuntu, follow the instructions below: .
So, how my Jenkins bitbucket plugin should gets need branch name from received webhook?
On the other hand, the pipeline job can be repository-neutral and branch-neutral and very flexible when working with multiple git repositories with a single Jenkins job.
In Jenkins pipeline, when a build is run on a particular node, a workspace is allocated on that agent.
I checked in my Jenkins and I could see this:  .
In my case it 's /home/jenkins.
This plugin may be added in Jenkins by default in near future, /url/.
Unfortunately I have n't been able to figure out how to accomplish either solution when it comes to the Jenkins pipeline script.
Is there a way to include the necessary server certificate via the Jenkins pipeline script (so that it gets added to the workspace-specific conan home directory automatically)?
For an example of an entrypoint that does this, see this /url/ example of mine that matches the jenkins gid to that of the docker socket mounted from the host.
The second and simplest is to just go to the Jenkins Download Manager page in the admin console and update the URL so that the preamble is http instead of https.
I think you can fetch the current workspace by using /code/ env var of Jenkins.
Groovy Template file [$email_body] was not found in $JENKINS_HOME/email-templates.
Using latest Jenkins Community LTS edition i.e.
I already looked for .jenkins or JENKINS_HOME and all jenkins folders and ca n't find a single thing.
We use Jenkins with /url/ plugin and have  Multibranch Pipeline job defined to build our source code.
I 'm new to Jenkins and havnig trouble with some basic tasks.
archived existing jenkins home directory  .

You can use a combination of SNS Notifications for new artifacts in the S3 bucket /url/ and the Jenkins AWS SQS plugin to trigger a build (/url/) .
I do have a properties file with the right port which is located at conf/application-jenkins.properties.
In my case the user was root and home directory was /var/jenkins_home.
My question is ,can I automate, with the script, in docker that  Jenkins which is built should open in the browser when I run that image?
Headless Chrome also works, but the build serve I 'm sending this to is Jenkins and that team does n't have support for anything besides PhantomJS.
I want to extract all the relevant information from the jenkins console into archived files, so that devs do n't have to look at the console which confuses them.
You can add /restart after root url of your jenkins instalation and it will do what you need.
This is driving me nuts: I am trying to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile in a specific folder of my repository using a scripted Jenkins Pipeline, but it does n't get the correct path.
I have created a parameterized pipeline project in jenkins but i am not able to access those parameters in shell script  .
I added following property to jenkins Sonar analysis properties.
I also checked if the new baseline file on Jenkins did match the newly created one and it does.
I am new to Groovy/Jenkins DSL  and do n't know how to make it work.
I am new to Jenkins .
Can anyone please let me know how / provide helpufl links to deploy the jar in my local using jenkins .
My recommendation is to configure Jenkins to prefix all of its workspaces with a conveniently filterable string like /code/ so you can easily ignore them, and then to move on with your life.
If the answer to this is "write a Jenkins module", then fine, so be it.
How can I find out what Jenkins actually sees in the directory structure when it looks for the Jenkinsfile?
Knowing what Jenkins sees would make it a lot easier to figure out what syntax to enter for the configuration.
As you can see, the Jenkinsfile is located in the /code/ directory, even though Jenkins does not seem to be able to find it at that location.
I cannot create a simple list of filenames in a given directory in a scripted Jenkins Pipeline.
I have one repo which drives deployments and cloning its Jenkinsfile should kick off a new build; but I need the jenkins job which wraps it to watch another repo representing the site (not its build process), to watch for and build changes to the site, expected to change often, rather than the build process which hopefully will soon be stable and not subject to much additional change.
Jenkins, Consul, Prometheus and more are working just fine using the exact same ingress config as appended to the end.
I 'm following /url/ on the Jenkins official docs.
This tutorial shows you how to use Jenkins to orchestrate building and   testing a simple Node.js and React application with the Node Package   Manager (npm), as well as deliver different outcomes for development   and production purposes.
Can any one tell me what we should fill at host name section while we integrating PTC with jenkins.
This is where it checks out the repository and that will show you exactly what Jenkins "sees".
/pre/  Push it to Github and add new pipeline from Jenkins Blue Ocean .
Regarding the Jenkins workflow, I had felt doubts and adding here, .
When I am exploring I found that automated Docker image building option within Jenkins using some scripts (I do n't know properly exact working, I found in you tube video).
Seems like Jenkins is not ready for Java > 8 (yet) .
I 've seen mentions in Jenkins of editing the "nextBuildNumber" file to change a job 's next build.
You can try the solution given in the official site of Jenkins /url/ .
So, Please do not update jenkins as of now.
For integrate PTC with jenkins we need to follow some steps those are mentioned in below link : /url/ .
Open jenkins.xml file in note pad.
The only configuration I found was in the Configure System [Jenkins] section; .
I 'm new to jenkins.
I 'm exploring the options to get the pipeline (stages) information in Jenkins through Rest API.
I found a solution for that is to mount this directory on jenkins container: .
I 've created a very simple jenkins file: .
I created new Jenkins job for release task.
Jenkins NUnit plugin only allows to specify XML file paths in "Ant glob syntax".
I fixed this with adding the appropriate $M2_HOME to the PATH in jenkins configuration.
I am trying to integrate the badges plugin with the jenkins build monitor plugin, which according to the latest release notes should be possible now.
I am new to Jenkins, so I have struggled to find any documentation on this behaviour.
I am new to jenkins.
I want to build pipeline/jenkins job where once developer has pull request approved by other developers with 1 LGTM, I would build a new Master + the PR as new Master and run smoke tests.
For me the given Plug-Ins for Jenkins did n't work as they should.
I figured most of this out  from a bunch of SO questions with partial answers and several blog articles, and very little from actual Jenkins docs.
/pre/  This does not build when a new branch is created as the changeset is still empty in Jenkins when a branch is built for the first time.
I ended up using the plugin only for creating the archive, but then I copied manually the folders (users, jobs, plugins, nodes, email-templates, secrets, JENKINS_HOME files) from the archive to the new server.
Jenkins should then read this xml file.
I ca n't find nothing about creating jira tasks from gitlab ci  I created them from Jenkins by this way: .
You may have to extend the sleep if your Jenkins installation takes longer to start.
/pre/  Jenkins build just hanging on this part, if I comment out that section it works.. .
I 'm learning Jenkins these days and I faced a situation.
But when i run the same commands to run my build using a Jenkins Job like below it 's not updating the vendor bundle correctly because of which some parts of the application is not working right, especially /code/ .
i wanna know if there is a way to skip the report file generation on allure-report jenkins plugin on post-build action.
The problem is on Gitlab: I go to Settings -> Integrations and I try to configure a webhook by adding the Jenkins project URL that I have found in the project configuration (highlighted below): .
I am new to Jenkins and I am trying to automate the test cases as a stage in Jenkins file.
I could find no reference to /code/ in the Jenkins documentation, so I created a build to try to clarify their relationship.
Using Jenkins DSL plugin I 've come across /url/ and /url/.
My guess is that in your Jenkins config (build steps), you have not specified anything, or you provide the wrong profile.
/pre/  Please let me know how I can wrap my several stages /code/ in Jenkins declarative syntax.
My Jenkins build is failing since a couple of days ago.
I have created a Dockerfile (for a Node JNLP slave which can be used with the Kubernetes Plugin of Jenkins ).
Edit: I understand that this can be done using the /code/ Jenkins plugin where I can explicitly mention the /code/ name, but I need to do this from the Jenkins UI.
It works perfectly well when running on backend as Jenkins user in the job 's workspace directory.
I have a requirement to upload zip file to appDynamics, i need to use the httpsrequest plugin for that from my jenkins pipeline .
I have a jenkins job that amongst other things I want to dynamically create a /code/ and a /code/ file in my jenkins workspace home directory as the job is running.
One simple solution would be to associate your Jenkins job with a source controlled repository URL, which already include the files with the right content.
I 'm trying to populate a drop down list which should contain all the files and directories exist in one of the jenkins master directory.
The Jenkins kubernetes plugin will always create a JNLP slave container inside the pod that is created to perform the build.
I 'm trying to get the following features to work in Jenkins' Declarative Pipeline syntax: .
/pre/  Within my Jenkins' configuration, I have only "poll SCM" selected.
This ensure Jenkins to compile any branch correctly because web-app contains commit hash for relative submodules.
How can I create and start an emulator in Jenkins?
But Jenkins can not find it somehow.
I already set the path of the msbuild.exe in the jenkins properties.
My project is just a simple WinForm to test if Jenkins is working well for me or not.
I am new in Jenkins.
I think the task comes from Jenkins.
Not sure what made jenkins look for /code/.
Jenkins will not auto import new key of known host to your know_host file.
Register key in know_host file Jenkins will not auto import new key of known host to your know_host file.
But now with Jenkins or fastlane i am not able to do it since i could n't find any API that generates this report.
Created new Freestyle Project in Jenkins .
Note /code/ is the jenkins project name and /code/ is for the workspace of it.
You need to tell jenkins to use the Folder plugins to do that .
There is a help page at the bottom right of almost every Jenkins pages.
config.xml is the format Jenkins uses to store the project in the file system, so you can see examples of them in the Jenkins home directory, or by retrieving the XML configuration of existing jobs from /job/JOBNAME/config.xml.
I know we can do with the Java api but not sure about groovy and jenkins.
Make sure your branch names do not have slashes in them, (ex release/1.2.3) as this confuses a lot of key tools in Jenkins.
/url/ This is the link to the documentation for this by jenkins, but I do n't find a hint for my problem.
I am learning about Jenkins and I have to explore some existing build jobs that others wrote (in the company that I 'm working).
You need to check your jenkins project name.
I run into a problem, Jenkins do everithing great except documentation generating.
Here is screenshot of /code/ directory contents in console, it is clear that Jenkins plugin did n't generate documentation, but why?
note: I am using Jenkins declarative pipeline syntax.
/code/ always required name of jenkins job followed by /code/ .
It sounds like you are expecting the Jenkins plugin to produce the documentation.
If your build steps do n't produce Javadoc, then Jenkins wo n't be able to archive and provide a link to  it.
The Blue Ocean interface to a Jenkins multibranch pipeline project shows several branches that were automatically created.
Here 's a link to the artifactory help page where they setup jenkins with a access token: /url/ .
You need to first tell Jenkins what the MSBuild tool is: .
Please bear with the nesting, but I am unable to clone a submodule in a docker image in a jenkins organization job.
Go to your Jenkins home page.
I read about some relevant tools, and right now the most appropriate tool I found is Jenkins.
When I check the jenkins page for that job.
You can see good documentation here for Jenkins too /url/ If you have more budget, then I would suggest your TeamCity or TFS.
After searching a while and e. g. tried to specify the environment variables HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY (see also /url/) I found /url/ and used gerritforge/jenkins-slave-bazel for building (proxy configured also for docker): .
I am trying to schedule job on jenkins which is dependent on another Maven project, I tried everything pipeline, multiphase phase project, but I am getting below issue repetitively; .
The problem I have is that on Jenkins job page there are only links to the test reports, there is no link available to download an application which was archived.
The jenkins documentation state the following for the /code/ tag when defining a node.
From a Jenkins job I executed the following after upgrading to the developer edition where I Pass the project key and name in.
So my question is: How can I ensure that this jenkins job gets picked by a node that  has docker installed?
I already had a look on the "Publish over SSH" plugin, but this just do work from Jenkins to remote, but not the other way around.
Then when a new PR is created, then jenkins is tiggered and it 's start the build, and at first it 's trying to delete the complete workspace.
Now my question is what information are we missing, and how could we configure the git pluggin to make the jenkins start working on our existing project?
I am not able to find the instructions on Jenkins Gradle Plugin wiki page.
I currently try to setup building pipelines with Jenkins as the conductor of all of it and I'am spending a lot of time to understand how to correctly setup Firebugs, PMD, Android-Lint, jacoco, build warnings and so on.
I have a python project I 'm working on and am trying to implement tests with pytest and Jenkins.
I stumbled on this question while I was tearing my hair out trying to figure out more or less the same thing (in my case, I needed to know how the proxy compatibility option mapped to Jenkins' config.xml).
Created a credential in Jenkins using the google project name as the id and the json key.
When I am exploring the deployment using Kubernetes and Jenkins, I found tutorials and many videos for deploying in both test and prod environment by creating and defining in the Jenkinsfile.
/pre/  Then you 'd configure your Jenkins client like this (I think; I do n't really know anything about the Jenkins configuration): .
My question is : I have seen I can add only one repo in Jenkins, so I add QA repo.
The fix: Jenkins has the path hard-coded in /code/.
I 'm a noob in Jenkins Pipeline trying to convert a bunch of DSL Flow (Deprecated from Jenkins 2.x) type jobs to Pipeline type Jobs.
Each time we want Jenkins to start building a new branch, we go through all 7 multibranch project configurations and update this field to include the new branch.
I 've started lately to use Jenkins and i need some help with creating a pipeline.
I have been going through jenkins manual but I could not understand the difference between using config.jelly (local configuration) and global.jelly (global configuration).
My confusion is when I use the zap plugin in Jenkins, there is a starting point URL which is mandatory.
But building to production can ONLY be done manually and Jenkins cannot start it automatically.
I know Jenkins has a concept of parameterized build where the build could be parameterized by the Sonar Server name.
Where /code/ and /code/ are parameters defined in jenkins .
I 've read some thread about Jenkins no longer being able to build Java projects with JDK older than 8 (I 've only searched about Maven though).
There 's probably something I missed as I 'm new to Jenkins but could n't find out after some hours.
I am beginner of ionic mobile development and now I am setting CI for my mobile application using Jenkins (on localhost).
The same computer is also used by the developers in their daily work over RDP, and the Jenkins-job in question is run in the night when no regular developer is using it.
Jenkins gives guidance and examples on this for freestyle projects (but the principle should be the same for pipeline), see: /url/ .
The directory you 're checking for the files is /code/, is on the executor node - the Jenkins, right?
I am new to the Jenkins, please help me.
The Jenkins Pipeline shared docs include this: .
I am working on a Jenkins project to remotely startup and shutdown a specific VM with user-supplied parameters.
In the Startup portion of the build step, I can use /code/ to determine if the specified VM is listed, and thus process it as such and indicate that the Jenkins build to startup the specified VM is successful.
Set branches to build to either ** or refs/heads/rob-jenkins (a branch in git) .
What I do: I make a change to a file in rob-jenkins branch, push and the job is not started in Jenkins.
I have a Docker container created from the official Jenkins image.
In Jenkins Post-build Actions i have an action named "Copy files back to the job 's workspace on the master node" where i want to copy all the content of indicated directory.
The reason for my doubt is because every example is showing the creation of pipeline with Jenkins and GitHub project.
/pre/  But jenkins was not able to recognize the both branches.
We 're working on an open source project called /url/ which is a proposed sub project of the Jenkins foundation aimed at automating CI/CD on Kubernetes using Jenkins pipelines and GitOps for promotion across environments.
We 're working on an open source project called /url/ which is a proposed sub project of the Jenkins foundation aimed at automating CI/CD on Kubernetes using Jenkins pipelines and GitOps for promotion across environments.
Here 's /url/ for promotion between environments and Preview Environments on Pull Requests which was done live on GKE though Jenkins X supports most kubernetes clusters .
So jenkins report ca n't find /code/ in current folder or /code/.
Note that Jenkins X only supports git right now though.
To learn how to manipulate Docker images from within Jenkins, I am reading /url/.

My team is using keybase.io instead of slack, and I 'd like our Jenkins results to post into the builds directory of our keybase team.
In Jenkins choose Post Build Task then I write  C:\Users\yourUser.jenkins\workspace\yourProject\new.bat in area script  .
I 'm a Jenkins beginner, and I have tried searching and found many Jenkins plugins that seem like they can help (i.e.
I am looking for something which will automatically validate the coding standards in Jenkins.
i am struggling how to do continuous deployment or delivery in jenkins which main feature where spring boot app name or jar file name changes that time.
I was following the tutorial /url/ To integrate Jenkins on Azure and set it up to work with my container registry and kubernetes.
Using the Job DSL plugin, I 'm trying to make the seed job generate new jobs in a Jenkins folder relative to the location of the seed job.
Although you cannot use broadcast on AWS you can add to the java command and specify the hostname or URL of the LB of the jenkins master.
Deploy to a snapshots or releases directory based on a non-hard-coded flag (could be in Jenkins job) .
Initially I thought someone is doing this, so to track the config changes I installed Job config history plugin in Jenkins and what I find is strange.
I am not sure if this Jenkins Bug or some plugin is playing with my soul.

Jenkins starts the release process when a new commit is pushed to root  'master' branch but the plugin failed the build because on the submodules the HEAD is detached.
Searching other questions here, seems that the solution is to configure Jenkins to checkout the local branch but this not works with submodules.
I hope something from this list will help (as well I mostly leave it for me in the future when I 'll have to install Jenkins for CentOs again :) .
I have a yml file that I need to fill with Jenkins.
/pre/  So, I define Jenkins params: .
In your YAML version, you used the name "jenkins-slave" thereby indicating to the the plugin that you want the default jnlp container (/code/) to be launched in the pod along with your "jenkins-slave" container.
Now you want to create one more Jenkins jobs (i.e Job-RepoB) for Repo B and add this job as post-build action in Repo A job (Job-RepoA).
3.2 Gerrit 's comment add can also trigger Jenkins job build, so the conn works well.
But “Jenkins-local” groups defined by any authorization strategy are not working.
I 'm kinda new to Jenkins, I 've done some work with it, but i am stumbling on question that i will explain right away: .
I have been tasked, by the senior software developer at my job, to find a service that has the functionality of Katalon (a Selenium-like automated testing framework that I 'm already falling in love with), Jenkins (the continuous integration tool we 're using), and TestRails/Zephyr.
Our problem with Jenkins is that everything has to be configured on it as a plugin, which is costing our small team time and money.
I do n't know how to do it because the image of bitnami jenkins has tomcat, apache2, etc.
i want to extend Jenkins Credential Plugin and add one more additional custom option, I could n't find a valid place to start with, neither jenkins has a good resource on this nor a third party documentation.
when im trying to copy files to working directory - represented in Jenkins by the system parameter WORKSPACE, for example like in this code:  .
/code/ this means you do not have slave(s) with those names, set them up according to guide of jenkins (/url/) and then all will work .
They cannot be placed in the jenkins lib since the plugin will not be able to find them.
This question was originally asked before the Jenkins Pipeline existed.
Although you can continue to use and configure Jenkins through the GUI, it 's currently recommended to transition your projects to the pipeline.
This can be installed by going to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Search for AWS Beanstalk Publisher.
You will still need to fill in the /code/ section of the Jenkins Job configuration.
I checked the Jenkins questions and forums as well, but they do n't seem to provide a solution.
So I know that the shared library is there, but I 'm confused with the way groovy / Jenkins handle classes / shared libraries.
But if I open it directly from Jenkins with Firefox, the HTML looks crappy.
I have the HTML publisher plugin on my Jenkins but I am not using it, at least not explicitly.
I 've found tons of information/example in order to move a Jenkins job into a new folder or subfolder, for example: .
Add the certificate to the Jenkins startup parameters: .
This may sound like a stupid question, but I am installing Jenkins-X on a Kubernetes cluster on GKE.
Am I correct in installing Jenkins-X through Cloud Shell (and not on a particular node)?
So In my previous stack overflow discussion , I found that adding one SVN plug in Jenkins.
Jenkins have many plugins but their name are very confusing,  .
so do you know which jenkins plugin can be used to poll new/changed pull request from /code/?
I lost all the projects that had used 'jenkins pipeline'.
I looked at the URL from the Configuration System, and I opened my jenkins.xml.
But I don´t see any URL in my jenkins.xml file, where I should add it?
I 'm working with jenkins pipeline and have a shared global library.
For that I have created a job in jenkins as create item --> free style project --> under SCM I select git an give the url of my project -- > go to build trigger --> poll SCM -- > I give * * * * * as  schedule.
I have just started to learn Jenkins so not much Idea.
I 'm using Jenkins with a branch parameter to specify the branch to build from.
The Jenkins documentation for this is sparse.
I am trying to use kubernetes and Jenkins for my deployment of micro services developed using spring boot.
The answer was to create a Jenkins Home directory instead of trying to use the default setup.
The parameters that you create in the general step of jenkins job are only accessible in the build step.
Why does jenkins check out code to such many places?
How can I get the actual Jenkins' checkout found in stage('Build')?
You 're on the right track to use Jenkins WebHooks with JIRA, you could find more details on this /url/.
Here is what my Jenkins file looks like .
The Jenkins /url/ plugin was developed by the same folks^ and appears to depend on JUnit as well .
I am using bitbucket pipeline for CI, but I am sure Jenkins will work fine as well.
If I understand well your problem, you could solve it by using the Jenkins multijob plugin.
So to ensure that people remembers to update the semantic version I would like to either check that the gradle.properties file HAS changed compared to the point where the branch was created - But since we use shallow clones on our jenkins server there is no information about this.
As for your question about how Jenkins knows what job to build, my understanding is that the /url/ a link to the repo/branch, and Jenkins looks this up internally to find the job that references this repo (the stuff you defined in the job settings page above).
Have on mind, that gitea has its /etc/gitea/app.ini file, where ssh domain, gitea server domain and http url are specified and you specify gitea srvers in jenkins.
I would say that setting up your own local Jenkins sandbox where you can play around with Jenkinsfile scripts is the easiest way to start with.
npm: command not found it is unable to find node or npm in Jenkins user  .
Option 3: build using AWS Fargate (need to look in to this a bit) – so the docker image is not built on Jenkins slave nodes and the build won’t affect the files on the nodes .
It is just a workaround until Jenkins team fix it but it works pretty well for us.
You can use jenkins /url/ for passing variables to the downstream projects.
I successfully setup Jenkins, created a new job for the Katalon testing, /url/, but when I went to build it, I get failing builds.
Not entirely sure if this will work the Post build Action Git Publisher (as I do n't use it), and I can only test this on:  Jenkins ver.
I wrote up a doc on how i got Jenkins working from installation to deployment.
Not sure of how to use it, but its settings match those on the previous Jenkins instance.
It actually says "TODO provide a sample with Jenkins Declarative Pipeline") .
When working in Jenkins and groovy I found the below useful example that shows how to find all Jenkins jobs and print some property from it: .
Hi I 'm learning how to use Jenkins integrated with Docker and I do n't understand what should I do to communicate them.
I believe Jenkins is finding the /code/ but it is just not finding the /code/.
If I know a class name or field name in the Jenkins model for whatever I am dealing with, I often find it easier to go directly to the Jenkins source code on GitHub to understand it.
Of course you could pull down all the Jenkins source code locally and navigate and search through it with something like IntelliJ IDEA or another Java IDE.
I am facing an issue where maven style jenkins job often gets stuck for hours at the "Scanning for Projects" phase.
/pre/  My Jenkins file looks like: .
I 'm configuring my Jenkins job to build only branches that contain the string /code/ in its name, e.g : .
/code/ return your current workspace: /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/integerBuild .
I am using jenkins blue ocean plugin btw.
If you do n't specify a folder in the /code/ declaration it will be in the main Jenkins view.
Any recommendations on where to handle this check Maven or Jenkins (I 'm leaning towards handling this in maven, but still wondering how) ?
Try adjusting your Jenkins config to use hyphens instead.
If you homebrew installed JENKINS, then by default, JENKINS_HOME is at ~/.jenkins  This is also the location where you will find you will find your initial password inside the secrets folder.
In the post action of the jenkins job I have selected editable email notification and mentioned the file path in the attachment.
I changed jenkins-slave.xml to use this path: .
I 've tried looking everywhere but ca n't find any information on how to introduce an optional branch build according to a parameter in the source code management section of jenkins.
If I create job within Jenkins with Pipeline plugin and run this job I get  .
When you deliver a new change you can commit with a specific message like ('pom  modified from jenkins build').
I 'm looking for a solution for Jenkins running in blue ocean.
I created a pipeline using Blue Ocean on Jenkins to run something stored on our GitHub Enterprise.
I click on "Build Now" button, and Jenkins, start a new task, after finished that task, it starts a new task and so.
After moving my jenkins home directory from /code/ to /code/ for more disk space with the following commands:  .
Under Jenkins Location specify your public Jenkins URL.
I have an existing Jenkins-Sonarqube integration for daily sonar violation check using SonarScanner.

So basically, how can I tell Jenkins to build anything matching Git branches /code/ and following, ignoring /code/ up to /code/?
One option would be to tell Jenkins "you have seen+built these branches" - something which Jenkins remembers automatically if you tell it to build "release/*" - it will build "release/1.0" only when someone pushed something new to that branch.
How does one go about finding the documentation on Jenkinsfile configuration options provided by Jenkins and the plugins that are installed?

And within Jenkins pipeline job, I can add different configuration.
I have cloned a jenkins job and made changes according to my new configuration, but after few days the job 's configuration changes to old one.
Note the colon at the beginning tells Jenkins to treat this as a regexp.
Both repositories belong to the same project and team for which the private key is configured and added to jenkins, so I assume that chekout and submodule procedures do n't use the same authentification method.

I found my happiness with Jenkins and the plugin xUnit (/url/).
I know it 's not exactly what I asked at first (it 's not fully integrated with GitHub) but Jenkins looks really good for what I need.
To do this they must be added to /etc/default/jenkins and added to the deamon arguments in /etc/init.d/jenkins .

I have mainly just attempted setup for this in the web UI in the Jenkins global config, I have not yet tried to setup the pod templates within a Jenkinsfile yet.
Paths in the .sln file need to be relative to the location of the .sln file so that when Jenkins can checks out the entire solution into its workspace from source control the paths resolve.
Check that all the project files defined in the solution file (and all their files in turn) are indeed being checked out to the Jenkins job workspace folder.
If it is n't then my bet is your Jenkins job is n't checking it out from source control into its workspace and therefore not finding it when the solution tries to compile.
But I saw in Jenkins you need to put the scripts in Jenkinsfile, but I cannot find a good reference on how to run ruby scripts this configuration.
I 'm assuming this is the Jenkins workspace directory and will overwrite anything already there.

Is there any settings for this in Jenkins front end.
Do you have any excluded source files in Jacoco and Jenkins that you didn’t exclude in SonarQube properties, or vice versa?
In the example you gave (/code/) Jenkins needs to know the absolute path to this location on your build slave because if it did n't, it would n't be able to check out your source and build it.
There 's a complete list of generally available environment variables provided by Jenkins available /url/.
/pre/  It looks like the /code/ block is failing when Jenkins reads the Jenkinsfile which is rather confusing at the Jenkinsfile looks fine to me.
First of all, I think that one of the Jenkins/Cloudbees recommendation is to avoid builds on master.

Here 's a simple Jenkins pipeline job that highlights the different working directories seen by /code/ vs /code/.
/pre/  I find it curious that they would be different working directories, the shell command /code/ step uses the workspace as the working directory while the groovy /code/ step uses the directory the Jenkins process was launched.
Question: how can I make my Jenkins scripted pipeline steps (/code/) use the workspace as the working directory by default?
I guess it makes sense after realizing this most clearly, that groovy is a java thing and we launch the Jenkins war file from java, and that launching imposes a certain working directory.

I think you 're mis-understanding the reason you would use Jenkins, i believe it 's designed to do exactly what it is doing, you need to install a different test-framework along with Maven and Selenium.
It set to /code/ by default (if you accepted this during initial start of Jenkins) .
/pre/  You also can find more such environment variables for your Jenkins instance on this page: /url/ (replace /code/ with your Jenkins URL) .
/pre/  Of course (sadly) when old builds are purged by Jenkins the old artifacts are left because jenkins will not follow a symlink when purging, even if jenkins owns the symlink and the target (shame).
I workaround for that may be to point a symlink back from the new archive dir, then, when jenkins purges it 's archive dir, the new symlink will dangle and a cron job can then later delete the new job archive dir .
I started to use Jenkins recently.
This xml is triggered using a batch file and configured as a build step in Jenkins.
You can define a password parameter in jenkins job and the same can be used in your github script.

Furthermore the home directory /jenkins is created for the user, and used as a mount point.
Jenkins has a similar feature, where it puts up a banner saying 'Jenkins is going to shut down' and stop queuing new builds.
In addition to that, I 'd suggest you also to learn Jenkins, as it is REALLY usefull for automated tests in server.
Also after this configuration, you can pass /code/ from command line to dynamically changing the base url from jenkins for /code/.

So I think (somehow) I want to parametise a jenkins folder with all the jobs in with the name of the api package, pass that into the build script and then get the build script to swap out whatever the engineer has referenced and reference the parameter.
i’ll try looking at the paket.dependencies/paket references files in the build script, remove the existing reference, and add the jenkins defined ones from a shell and paket and aee what happens, dont especially like it, im dependent on the format of these files and i was hoping this would be mainstream .
I do n't know where could I fit the jenkins tool in the following devops pipeline: .
When I execute the command on the jenkins node by hand, it works as expected, but as you can see, even though this is running as the owner of the folder, it looks like it is trying to create the root folder (/home/jenkins) which it obviously does n't have permission to create.
By default Jenkins does n't do anything beyond the SCM checkout on its own.

Depending on how you have integrated Github with Jenkins and what plugin you have have used, the method might vary.
But usually you have support for "magic"-sentences that will retrigger Jenkins if added as a comment on Github.
For example commenting "test this please" or "retest this please" in Github might retrigger Jenkins.
The few examples I find suggest Jenkins and SendMail are all I need but if that 's the case then the setup does n't work.
I am trying to create a job in jenkins that picks up a recently scanned image from a harbor repository and deploys it into an existing kubernetes cluster.

Read up on "Distributed builds" on the Jenkins wiki: .
Created new jenkins free style project .
So my question is, how/where do you configure Jenkins GitHub pipeline to only build on certain branches rather than scanning all branches?
Moved someones code from a old pipeline plugin, jenkins 1.6?
When I look at Jenkins I can see the agent is being created but for some reason it ca n't talk to it via port /code/ (or perhaps the pod ca n't talk to the agent!)
Interestingly if I define all these containers in Jenkins configuration, things work smoothly.
Probably best to have separate jenkins master nodes but configure agents such that they can be shared across teams/projects.
I a trying to figure out how to set the jenkins root url: .
Now here comes the odd problem: I have user A who created Jenkins instance on the Openshift, have owner account on Github on the repository.

Within a Jenkins pipeline we create a project via a template yaml file.
The advantage of using Jenkins is that you link your new version builds to other activities, as well as the possibility to trigger a release when certain conditions have been met, rather than starting the build manually.
I am working on a Jenkins POC for work.
Now I added a new one /jenkins(.
To solve this problem for myself, I ended up creating a separate Jenkins job (Free Style project, not pipeline) which was setup to Poll SCM on the /code/ repo.

I think it behaves like this since I 've updated a couple of Jenkins plugins.
Why Jenkins cannot find file.
After a research I found a way if you use BRANCH SOURCE as GitHub and set Orpahned Item Stratergy to 0 or unselect it then the PR 's that are merged or branches that are removed from GitHub will be automatically removed from Jenkins.
You actually do n't need a Jenkins project per suite, just configure the tests via CLI arguments and your harness will pick that up for you.

I 'm having trouble with this particular step because Jenkins consistently is unable to find /code/ and /code/: .
Why is Jenkins unable to find my /code/?

Since this question was posted some changes have been made to jenkins so that it only clones the repo if you are a person who is allowed to make changes to the Jenkins script (you can configure your jenkins as to how it determines this).
There is one project I have where I want to create a single archive with a bunch of files, so for that, I have a build step that creates a zipfile first (granted, this is in Jenkins and not TeamCity).
We were doing this using a ant script to update the config.xml file, but it does not work in Jenkins 2.

I am new with jenkins and continuous integration so please tell me if I have any wrong concept or silly questions.
In the GitHub status check section I only see one check with the following title:  /code/, which directs me to the test Jenkins pipeline.
This means that our build pipeline is not being picked up by GitHub even though it is visible on Jenkins.
Now, In Jenkins, I 've created another job with branch filter as different branch name.
Now my question is, How do i setup a web hook in Gitlab to trigger a different Jenkins job when there is a change in a specific branch.

Now, when JaCoCo works, it produces a /code/ file that actually contains a coverage report that can be shown later in various ways (jenkins plugin to show coverage, sonar integration whatever).
My specific example is using the JSON schema provided  by the Jenkins configuration as a service plugin to validate my jenkins.yaml file.
I need to understand how to take the schema generated by the Jenkins configuration as a code plugin, and validate a YAML file used by the same.
So I already connected Jenkins and Gitea but I want also Sonar to analyze my Project.

Jobs need to bootstrapped while the Jenkins starts can be copied to /usr/share/jenkins/ref/jobs/ folder.
But keep in mind that if the jobs(or any) already exist in Jenkins home folder, updates from /usr/share/jenkins/ref/jobs/ folder wo n't have any effect unless you end the files with *.override name.
Since the workspace path is dependent on the jenkins project name the path was wrong.

This made sense because developers should not be messing with resources created by automation, and any operations to the jenkins backend should be done by jenkins, otherwise devs could overwrite resources that jenkins put up, and vice versa.
EDIT: Another way of accomplishing this would be if the sonarscanner or the jenkins plugin could create the sonar project for the app if it does n't exist when it runs.
This worked but I want to use a Gitlab repository to store the jenkins.yml file.

People create, delete and rename Jenkins jobs all the time and asset management and tracking Jenkins job resources can be painful.
So on top of copying over the users directory, you 'll want to copy over the secrets directory as well as the secret.key file, which can all be found in your $JENKINS_HOME directory: .
The standard Jenkins notify url is: .
/pre/  is there a way to POST to the Jenkins url with a body, and use the body with a parameterized build?
To write file, Jenkins pipeline supply alternative /url/ which has no such restriction.
I can get things working but seperately for example with the the code included below for my /etc/nginx/sites-availiable/default sript, when i go to my main domain, it redirects me to the jenkins sign in page.
/pre/  Notice /code/ - I have done this so that I can access the docker daemon from within Jenkins as per /url/ article.
So that will probably help alleviate some of the restrictions around upgrading Jenkins, if that 's what we need to do.
Finally, whatever we do with the plug-ins and Jenkins version, I need to make sure the change is going to persist if Kubernetes re-starts the node in the future.
Along with Sonar, we have decided to add veracode integration to our Jenkins file.

I tried running a sonar analysis using a java project on Jenkins using the standard maven sonar:sonar goal and also using the post step>> Execute SonarQube scanner.
If that is the case I would suggest looking into something a bit more advanced called /code/ (/url/) with a couple of jenkins plugins as /code/ /url/ which can automatically detect all the branches in your repository and setup a job for each one.
Doing this, Jenkins will only build merged changes of this topic and you only need to add the "build" topic to the child change to let Jenkins know what commit you want to build.
Doing this, Jenkins will not build when the changes are merged and you can trigger the build from the child commit just adding a "build" comment in the child change on Gerrit.
I just spent a day wading through a decade 's worth of /url/, forum posts and the Jenkins Subversion Plugin /url/ and /url/.
I then parametrised the jenkins build task, after which I can get feature branch name as "origin/feature/JIRA-0101", but I cannot parse this whole string in Jenkins to pick only JIRA task.
You are missing the correct framework for the task you want to execute on your Jenkins so you have to install it.
Jenkins is also managing to create other files, such as the  /code/ files, and the index.html fine.
I was trying to find main html page or index file of Jenkins to modify the url from jenkins-dev to jenkins-test but I ca n't find it where it is.
It 's showing  a class="task-link" href="https://jenkins-dev.xxx.xxx/newView" .
I have been tasked with setting up automated deployment and, after some research, settled on Jenkins to get the job done.
After modifying the URL to 'jenkins-test.xxx.xxx', New View menu was also fixed not to direct to 'jenkins-dev.xxx.xxx'.

As soon the jobs are ordered and the desired jobs are confirmed the task of Jenkins is finished and then it triggers the next build as defined in the configuration (Post build action : build the next job with some existing parameters).
On a Windows agent, assuming you have set it up as a Windows service wrapping a call to Java Web start, you should see a jenkins-slave.xml file in the agent 's target folder.
So I do n't know the exact configuration of the jenkins.
In the agent configuration screens, Jenkins is talking about: .

But then I provisioned a Jenkins instance and I realised something new: When a pipeline runs, Jenkins creates a Pod with an adapted agent (example: a Spring Boot app will need a Maven agent).
But I can not find Mercurial section inside /code/, to configure Mercurial Paths in Jenkins.
Search for Jenkins  .
Also I Googled a little bit and it seems everyone calls the Jenkins job build URL with the /code/ in the URL, but as I mentioned, the tool does n't allow to put URLs like that.
/pre/  So  after the after first checkout GITURL repository ( branch - develop) is getting downloaded in the jenkins workspace under job name folder on windows slave node and after the second checkout,GITURL1 repository (branch - master) is getting downloaded  inside the same job name folder under the folder - XYZ.

I 've tried looking online for how to resolve this, but the issues I found were dealing with the Jenkins plugin (which I am not using) and were with artifactory instances where a user had admin rights.
/pre/  Consider the above sample example (assume /code/ will be provisioned by Jenkins Default Pod template and will be attached to this pod) .
/pre/  I suppose that Jenkins is looking for the file on a master host, not an agent node where workspace is located.

Where is the default email-ext groovy template placed under jenkins.

First detect the changed branch and then checkout this specific branch out (I know that a webhook from  bitbucket/github to jenkins would work.).
It doesnt contain beautiful visual pipeline features which Jenkins has.
Additionally, when I create a simple pipeline job in Jenkins with the problem branch it builds ok and inspection of the workspace shows the head attached.
I know i could do this by having a webserver and with the help of PHP or other language designing a page to include the three jenkins job URLs.
Example how to use, where /code/ is name of /code/ configuration in Jenkins /code/.
Folks,   Am looping over environment variables from Jenkins and am trying to build a list to then pass to /code/ to then generate a Kubernetes yml.

@venkatesh I think you are referring to podTemplate() used inside a jenkins file.
/pre/  a yaml file can be used directly inside a jenkins file as a template.
when I use the master branch in git-lab, I commit and my hook works well after that my Jenkins pipeline will start.
On the project section of the configuration page you just have to click Add > Pipeline Jenkins and then you can choose the custom name that jenkins will look for the pipeline.
For folks using Jenkins pipeline with git plugin, use /code/ under /code/ of /code/ section.
We are setting up a Jenkins-based CI pipeline on our Kubernetes cluster (Rancher if that matters) and up to now we have used the official /code/ image for experiments.
According to the Jenkins Documentation /url/, crumbs are now only valid for the web session in which they were created.

I am working on adding a jenkins Declarative pipeline for automation testing.
If you are using jenkins declarative pipeline, you can set this as environment variable that gets picked up by AWS SDKs.
Go to Manage Jenkins > Config File Management > Add a new config and insert here your settings.xml  .
It works well, but one of my users is complaining, that he must select the jenkins settings.xml and global config in every single jenkins project under "Build -> Advanced -> settings file / global settings file".
We are doing it in order to use declarative syntax pipelines as I can see in the documentation that: "Declarative syntax is available from version 3.0.0 of the Jenkins Artifactory Plugin" (/url/) .
So the question is: Is holding the configuration on Jenkins itself the best practice for this, and if so, how can it be achieved?
This worked nicely as I could see from jenkins what areas of the code lacked coverage.
To get around this, I 'm wondering if it 's possible to POST a new node to the Jenkins API.
In my experience, install Windows Jenkins slave as a service creating more issue to take care with, so I do n't go this route.

(Just to be clear, the question is not "how do I write a Jenkins pipeline?
Let 's say pull the PR in a comment, but what happens if people just comment and there is no PR - does this triggers a build in jenkins?
My main goal is to have jenkins build only be trigger when a parent story is set to resolve, how can I build the subtask assuming each subtask has one Pull Request?
I had 2 folders containing several jobs and a lot of others jobs placed directly in the Jenkins jobs root.
Created a new Multibranch pipeline in jenkins, added source with Git and applied the git url and test is success.
Aside from the list of dependencies can change for every plugin release (hence the auto-dependency resolution == good), Jenkins has progressively been unbundling plugins.
you can pass settings.xml please see attached image for jenkins.
The next question would be, since I have polling enabled, and currently it works as follows: if there 's a new push to the master branch jenkins starts to build the dev and staging stages and only when I want to deploy to production, I do it manually.
This uniqueness also ensures that, if you later rename a linked artifact source in its original location (for example, rename a build pipeline in Azure Pipelines or a project in Jenkins), you do n't need to edit the task properties because the download location defined in the agent does not change.
But this doc does not specify how to set the /code/ of the jenkins server.
And also it is not clear to me where to give the Jenkins Provider name.
Please provide a proper example for setup Jenkins Action Provider for AWS Codepipeline using AWS Cloudformation template.
