Team Services integration with Jenkins allows using both CI systems   with traceability through a single DevOps platform.
I 've just finished Google 's /url/ on how to implement continuous integration for a Go app on Kubernetes using Jenkins, and it works great.
Use Jenkins BlueOcean plugin: /url/  .
It looks like both the: /code/ and the /code/ were sending events to Jenkins that triggered a build.
I 'm trying to leverage the Jenkins credentials plugin to store sensitive data which I want to inject into Secrets within my Kubernetes cluster.
I 'm running Jest integration tests on Jenkins and I want to integrate them with TestRail in order to automatically put test results to TestRail.
/pre/  What is the best way to configure this behaviour in one jenkins job.
I 'm using Jenkins with Fastlane Scan.
In the Jenkins job I have also check the /code/ and added /code/ set to   'master' .
jenkins is a fine build system as well, but it will cost you a pretty penny to use - same with VSTS.
This help me to create many branches one for each APP_MODE, then when I need to send to tests or production I just make a merge and then send to jenkins deploy it .
You could take a look at how jenkins ssh-slaves are done from /url/ .
Go to the Jenkins home page and enter the job you want to build.
The Jenkins api-token is obtained for a specific user /code/ and can be used for that same user only.
But unfortunately I could n't find a way to do that using jenkins.
I am using /url/ to generate jenkins jobs.
I added /code/ plugin to my jenkins, and I want to use that as my deployment tool.
We created several Docker Templates (in the global Jenkins settings) and can use them in our build jobs, as long as we use the "never pull" strategy for the images .
Authorise SSH keys, make sure your jenkins user public key on server B exists in /code/ of the /code/ on server A. .
If you are using a version control, you can integrate it with CI(Jenkins) &amp; define/configure job to /code/ with value - /code/ .
Is it possible to define a workflow (for approval of changes that need to be moved to PRODUCTION, using jenkins for example?)
I have an jenkins url which requires login to view the contents.
If I understand correctly, you want any container running in your cluster to be able to access your jenkins service, but you do n't want your jenkins service to be accessible outside your cluster to something like your browser?
/pre/  This way, /code/ will show you the jenkins-ui screen because you have kubectl access.
I could not able to add two nodes under "Label Expression" in Jenkins configuration.
/pre/  I tried to access: /code/ but I was not able to access the jenkins UI.
I want to access my jenkins UI using a service but I want to keep it private in my cluster.
When i trigger a build in jenkins pipeline i use build.changeSets variable to retrieve all the changes to send by email like this: .
Is it possible to configure a Jenkins ssh node (slave) to authenticate on a port which is different than 22?
If you want to run the tests using continuous integration and Jenkins.
The SonarQube Scanner for Jenkins makes it /url/, but even if you 're not using Jenkins pipelines, you should still use webhooks instead of trying to retrieve this all manually.
But my setting was no effect in Jenkins.
When user was created, stop jenkins and run tomcat again, you will be able to login with created admin user in your tomcat/jenkins.
How can I define the set of those parameters in Jenkins interface so they will appear for each run of branch so that each new branch automatically becomes as "Parameterized build"?
Writing to log (or slack channel) in this context of using Jenkins is sort of stateless, for example you cannot check whether an alarm is currently triggered or not.
Since you cannot check if an alarm is already triggered - using jenkins with the logic you requested in your question ( 'snooze feature') can be very ugly.
if alarm not already triggered), but since there is no way for you to poll this information, or achieve this with Jenkins without the solution being 'hackish' like creating a file to indicate alert is on, and deleting it from another job if it was created more than 4 hrs ago - I would suggest looking at tools more suitable for the job.
We have a situation trying to run jenkins behind apache, .
To manage configurations across various environments, we used a very good approach that utilized build automation tools like maven and Jenkins, and a simple java program along with some bash scripting.
xclip -selection clipborad &lt; ~/.ssh/my-new-ssh-key added under Jenkins credentials SSH username with private key .
Then you can trigger SonarQube analysis from Jenkins using standard Jenkins Build Steps to trigger analysis with: .
User/Shared/Jenkins/Library/Mobile Device/Provisioning Profiles.
I 'm asking this because I want my Jenkins job to run certain analysis ONLY for those files whose change triggered the build.
In /etc/sysconfig/jenkins or /etc/default/jenkins change the follow line .
In my case here, I had added SSH key for 'admin' user of Jenkins and I had changed its password to 'admin' .
I want to set up GitHub webhook which will trigger Jenkins job.
If you do n't want to use Jenkins configuration you can hardcode all information in pipeline /code/  .
I have a react based web app which retrieves data from Jenkins APIs.
The xunit Jenkins plugin as an example allows a pattern like /code/ to search for your xml files, and this way you can parse all generated files without merging to a single file.
On other CI servers, like Jenkins, I can define a custom workspace for a job.
I would like to add a new status on an stage in the pipeline jenkins.
Also check these: /url/ on how you can do the same within Jenkins and for fun, look here: /url/ if you want to do some maintenance in Jenkins or in Artifactory.
We also have build server used for continuous integration using Jenkins.
/code/ contains my UI and backend apps while /code/ contains my Jenkins /code/.
Now I want to create a Jenkins job so that I can redeploy services in my /code/ namespace.
I am creating a Jenkins master/slave cluster and I am having trouble finding a way to have new slaves auto register themselves with the master.
Then I have to log in to the master node and Manage Jenkins -> Manage Nodes -> New Node and manually create the number of nodes I want.
/pre/  Also keep in mind that by default Jenkins does not allow to use /code/ class and if you did n't permit your server to do so you will get exception like: .
I wanna be able to use VERSION as any other Jenkins parameter: /code/ .
I am wondering if it it possible to use Jenkins to deploy without testing/building.
Is Jenkins able to do all these without test/build?
I should use Jenkins or maybe exists dokku files something like Pecilfile or ...?
Another way is to use a jenkins hook inside github which will trigger a build every time code is committed.
As mentioned above by Vadim Use Jenkins "Project-based Matrix Authorization Strategy" under  "Manage Jenkins" => "Configure System".
Now I want to configure browser launch operation from Jenkins without using it in my maven project.
Can we do this using plugins available in Jenkins ???
Now when I go Manage Jenkins -> Manage Nodes I can start a new node using this cloud provider: .
But I want to export automatically with jenkins.
In case you got a /url/-job (and you are a Jenkins-admin), use in the /url/ this script: .
I finally spotted the source of my problem, and I 'm so embarrassed - the scheduler user 's home directory was actually owned by jenkins, with the scheduler user as the group owner.
I do n't know jenkins so I hope the following makes sense.
I use windows batch command in jenkins for three environment(ortam) and I want to choose case that changes according to the condition.
/pre/  I have tried setting the Jenkins to run under my ID and allowed it to interact with the desktop.
Be careful that those options file is not taken into account by CI server like Jenkins etc.
My Jenkins experience is rather limited.
You have allowed the Jenkins service to interact with the desktop.
I 'm currently using Jenkins to trigger tests via an external test system and aggregate results.
Get The IP of your container and use your browser to open Jenkins Panel on port 8080. .
I use the /url/ and the /url/ in a normal jenkins job.
I 'm doing cross-platform testing (tooling, not kernel), so I have a custom image (used for ephemeral Jenkins slaves) for each OS, based on standard base images: centos6, centos7, ubuntu14, sles11, sles12, etc.
However, I 'd like for it to trip Jenkins.
Inside this script, you can access the current build via /code/, more importantly you have access the jenkins instance via /code/.
This will give you access to the majority of stuff in jenkins, including the list of jobs via in /code/ which you can search and get builds for each job.
/pre/  3) Run the tests like this on Jenkins: .
I 've made a pipeline in jenkins that does this, and for the filter part, i 've added another step like this: .
In case of Jenkins over a container managed by a Kubernetes POD is a bit more complex since: /code/ will you allow to access directly to the container running Jenkins, but you will not have root access, /code/, /code/ and many commands are not available and therefore a workaround is needed.
So what I am trying to do is be able to dynamically assign a throttle category/label to the build jobs in the jenkins file.
/pre/  Of course, permissions on "my_private_key" must be 0600 &amp; owner/group "jenkins:jenkins" .
/pre/  Credentials are stored in Jenkins' credential store and part of the script dives into the store to retrieve the password associated with the requested user account.
You can use the input step in a Jenkins pipeline and then pass that to an /url/ script that can enter the information for you.
I had a Jenkins 2.46 installation running on an EC2 box, associated to a IAM role through an instance profile.
To integrate Gatling and Jenkins you probably want to achieve 2 things.
Jenkins plugin can provide you much better visibility on Gatling tests results right in the Jenkins CI.
But it 's possible to have GAE automatically export the info for you, rather than doing it on-demand via jenkins.
/pre/  There are some configurations that needs to be applied in Jenkins(like enabling url triggers)  This post explains these steps very clearly  /url/ .
The best way to configure this is than the use the internal DNS and set the jenkins url to: .
I 'm trying to set up jenkins pipeline according to /url/ article but instead use google container registry to push the docker images to.
New to version 2.15 is the ability to add attachments using the Ant pattern matching syntax used in many places in Jenkins.
Instead why can we store the credentials in Jenkins with a meaningful Credential ID for each, and the Job would have an extensible-choice-parameter(drop-down) where we can list all the CredentialID in the drop.
And that supposes your Jenkins application publishes its port to the one you want, as /url/ by /url/: /code/.
I was thinking is there any way where we could set the apk name that is generated from jenkins which consists of jira story number in it.
But is there a way we use jira number in apk name or use jira number in the jenkins build number.
I am working on a Jenkins plugin where I 've designed my own custom view using Jelly and now I want to call a Java function /code/ on the /code/ event of a button.
Therefore, i am looking for suggestions if there are any plugins available in Jenkins pipeline 2 which gives me option "Restrict where this project can be run" in the configure page or is there any other way i can handle this scenario.
I 'm trying to track down a list of what is sandboxed in the Jenkins / Groovy playground.
/pre/  I want to use push the newly created access keys out to jenkins builders.
I am looking for a way to display the build progress bar of a build in jenkins to be able to display on my application.
you can use jenkins /url/ .
   You 'll need to edit Jenkins system configuration (Jenkins > Manage > System configuration) and add a new Cloud of type "Docker" .
manually triggering release builds in jenkins with a custom script which could compute the version number and maybe other release-related info (potentially more reliable, as you say), perform the signing and then programmatically create the GitHub release (and maybe push the necessary binaries/assets to it).
My plan is that a user will pass "definedVariable" value from Jenkins and I 'll create a target JSON file (after substi .
To get the jenkins admin password then run  /code/ .
If you use scripts for administrative tasks, I think the Jenkins CLI is a best place to execute.
As I want to use this sandbox regularly by a jenkins job and need to resync the data in the subprojects, I do n't want to resnc the whole sandbox.
If I define the library at the global Jenkins level to make it trusted, then it works like I want without exceptions.
I 'm looking for some way to block a possibility of making merge of pull requests on the BitBucket if some specified Jenkins task is currently running.
If you 're using Jenkins inside of a Docker container, like I am, the following commands might be useful.
You have to manage restrictions with the tools that Jenkins provides.
If you have administrator status go to "Jenkins configuration" (picture 1) and then to "Manage and assign roles" (picture 2).
it also simple and human readable and in jenkins-pipeline there are read and write operations for yaml .
The other solution could be to use the /url/ in Jenkins file: .
I am using Jenkins 2.89.3 and setup Jenkins Editable Email Notification with triggers as Always.
in addition I 've set up an ssh key for the jenkins user and registered it into github.
Go to Manage Jenkins -> Configure Global Security ->  .
I am trying to set up /url/ in a Jenkins job that is generated with the /url/.
/code/: Jenkins user name .
/code/: To get your API token, go to your Jenkins user page (top right in the interface).
There is an option in the "Configure" page of the Jenkins job for that (a recent addition I think).
If you are not using authentication for jenkins you can trigger a build for a job with a post-receive hook like .
/pre/  If you are using authentication, but allowing anonymous read access to jenkins, first set up a build trigger token under the job configuration  .
/pre/  Note: Anonymous read access is found under Manager Jenkins > Configure Global Security > Authorization > Logged-in users can do anything > Allow anonymous read access .
I am able to run the particular job using the jenkins api for npm.
I 'm using Sikuli and Selenium in this framework and I want to eventually start running this project from Jenkins.
By starting jenkins using /code/ instead of /code/ started the browser access.
the delay in agent registration is not just a jenkins issue, i have seen the same behaviour in gocd and other java based apps.
Note: if you need to check the Jenkins status, you can use this command: /code/ .
/pre/     Note: if you need to check the Jenkins status, you can use this command: /code/ .
We use GitFlow-like approach to branching so Multibranch Pipeline jobs in Jenkins as perfect fit for our project.
I 'm looking for a way to have several jobs in Jenkins, each one will be triggered only when code of appropriate application was changed.
We have Jenkins set without it and everything works fine, like so: .
/pre/  I have just checked our setup - we did no further config tweaks on Jenkins side (like ones tomcat for Jira would need), so your redirects are probably caused by that /code/ option.
I would like it more readily visible in Jenkins.
/pre/  BTW you can use a Jenkins constant too.
3.Configure jenkins security to allow the status view: Manage Jenkins -> Configure Security -> Authorization -> choose matrix-based security and check the "ViewStatus" box for the Anonymous user.
And, I know I can define the library at the global Jenkins level to make it trusted; however I 'd prefer sticking to the per-folder method if possible.
Running on Jenkins in    /Users/Shared/Jenkins/Home/workspace/wingman_423_ci_cd-7PSSGRAMBTXUQRESYCNVODXU7IZJLJLPHQOE3KYEPCSAAYAFFD4A .
I 'm using the the /code/ for Jenkins.
So two git repos are needed here, but a simple Jenkins job does not support multiple interlinked repos like this.
Apparently, the best solution is to use the Jenkins Pipeline Plugin, but I 'm aware it is complicated.
Is there any way to automatically run regression/functional tests on Nifi flows using Jenkins pipeline ?
I would want to have timestamp and I cannot find any explanation why it strips it with Jenkins running it.
I 'm using this on my Jenkins server as well which is using the xvfb-run command to create sort of a fake GUI to run the robot framework tests.
I want to run Chrome headless with a Jenkins Job in the future and it seems I need to get this working somehow.
I want to connect my already running jenkins container with mysql database which is another container.
Have created a database named jenkins and user named jenkins in mysql.
I am testing out Gitea and would like to it to trigger a Jenkins build, pretty basic use case.
I am using Jenkins to trigger some stuff on gcloud and I need to be able to pass a parameter from the Build with parameters menu to the gcloud command that is being triggered.
/url//url/ I have integrated my Acceptance testing Python Behave BDD with Jenkins and wanted to generate HTML report using Allure report.
I know this could be achieved with Jenkins or similar tools, but wondering is there any way to do it without a CI/CD tool.
In this way, everytime my container runs with jenkins user , it was able to create workspace in jenkins_home dir which had nobody user access.
We want to have buildNumber in Jenkins and Nexus consistent.
For the record: I 'm defining Jenkins pipelines and want to access some "global" methods outside from various stages .
A simple way of doing this would be to use the /url/ feature within Jenkins to define additional methods in a separate file.
Now in my case, I need to post to multiple channels and users from a Jenkins server and it is very cumbersome to manage multiple auth tokens.
It helps when you are able to run the integration tests without using your Jenkins file, so instead of using these nested docker.image statements, you should use docker-compose.
So I am trying to run jenkins inside my docker swarm and I want it to be able to execute docker commands to build new docker images.
I have a Jenkins 2.0 job where I require the user to select the list of servers to execute the job against via a Jenkins "Active Choices Reactive Parameter".
I am not able to execute selenium test cases using robotframework through Jenkins.
Works without using Jenkins.
This used to work well when I was using an older version of Jenkins but once I moved to this version I am not able to get this working without granting Anonymous user build/job permissions.
In order to get this working without any permissions granted to Anonymous user, I tried to have a user whose ssh public key is updated in the Jenkins web ui (user configuration).
Basically what I want is a single Jenkins pipeline job...which is capable of building from several branches.
That being said, your local Jenkins instance might want to connect to https site (for instance to check for plugins update).
I 'm trying to make a dashboard for test results (dynamically filtered by os/hardware/ect tags) from jenkins.
The scripts run when I login via domain user through powershell.I am using Jenkins for the CI/CD process.
The existing Slack integrations are one directional: Jenkins can use the token to send a message to the Slack app, but Slack has no way to return a result to Jenkins.
You can do this by either extending your jenkins image/Dockerfile or create(/code/) a new image after installing docker binary into it &amp; use that image for your CI/CD.
The idea is to use that image with CI (jenkins) to run some UI tests for an application that requires the availability of a Google Account for access to the Gmail app and Google Play.
I want to trigger a job which is setup on Jenkins from BitBucket (on push) .
In Jenkins, I want to get a user input and pass to a shell script for further use.
Currently, Jenkins add as a user any known user of Jenkins plus any user mentioned in a commit message.
Another side effect is that JENKINS_HOME/users are populated with one xml for each of these users, so Jenkins becomes somehow unmanageable.
I want to push code on AWS EC2 instances (in Autoscaling mode) using Jenkins as soon as new version of code is pushed in GitHub.
I want to push code to EC2 instances running in Autoscaling mode using Jenkins.
When i 'm building app on Jenkins, selenium hub is trying to connect to selenium node of AWS windows with private IP address.
After that we use Jenkins pipline groovy using multibranch.
For that I need Jenkins.
Now I can login into Jenkins using /url/ .
I 'm using Jenkins to run nightwatch tests on several components of my web app.
Make sure the Jenkins has the right to delete the folder and that it is not locked in some other way.
We can use shell regular expression to match the Jenkins projects.In this case we can use .
/pre/  Does this mean jenkins have not yet support user to iterate on stages?
From my understanding of /url/, Jenkins recommends using your user 's API key provided via HTTP Basic Authentication, not its password.
You will need to add /url/ on your Jenkins server allowing your page 's domain access to Jenkins resources, or have both Jekins API + your client page hosted from a single origin.
So in order to get the output into Jenkins I use /url/ to make Unity write to a specific logfile.
/pre/    Now in order to get the content of /code/ in realtime to the Jenkins log view I 'm trying to use /code/ to run the Unity process in a new console and use /url/ to print the content of the logfile in realtime to the console: .
But I got multiple components attached to application in uDeploy, and I would like to configure these multiple udeploy components in Jenkins CI job.
Please help me how to use multiple components in using jenkins job to invoke uDeploy.
Basically I want to create a shared library in Jenkins which turns: .
You have an Enterprise Git Repo and are still unable to hit the webhook Go to Manage Jenkins --> Configure System-->GitHUB under that you would have mentioned your GitHub Server details, Under that, there is an Advance button, Further under is another Advance button click that.
Typically, you would fill those proxy data in the Jenkins advanced tab of the proxy manager: .
I 've used Jenkins in the past to do this and Jenkins provides some nice graphs and tables showing test result history and coverage history as well as results from the most recent test.
Is there a way to push back to the repo that the Jenkins Pipeline checked out using the same process that the code was checked out with (using /code/)?
Navigate to 'Manage Jenkins' via the menu and Action any notifications displayed - plugins, data format conversions etc.
Also always put your pipeline scripts in source control and use a back up plug in for Jenkins.
There 's no reason to use bind-mounts or the docker socket to use Jenkins inside a docker container.
I 've not been able to find any way in Concourse to show a 'build summary page' as you get in Jenkins/TFS etc.
I use a /code/ to call /code/ that does non-Jenkins-specific git stuff to get the branch name: .
I would like to upgrade Jenkins to the latest version without losing job/user configuration.
And got a very simple question - after install we have system user jenkins: .
Jenkins created new user.
I want to see all jobs that are defined on our Jenkins.
Jenkins is basically a service/daemon i.e similar to lots of other services which does n't actually needs a shell to run like apache sendmail etc.
Jenkins uses the user /code/ to manage permissions &amp; segregation between services like other services do.
Create custom roles for Kubernetes nodes and for Jenkins, also don’t forget to add permission to assign the roles for kube2iam.
One thing what you can do is, in Build Section of the Jenkins Job, you can configure something like below.
I wanted to use the statistics provided in Jenkins through the Cobertura plugin (underneath /code/ is used to get the stats).
But to make this more "Jenkins" .
Looks like you want to run your Jenkins CI in a privileged mode.
But if you just want to call Docker from inside a Jenkins, you do n't need to use Privileged mode, you can just mount a Docker socket from the node to a Jenkins container.
Unfortunately, Jenkins slaves need to use Docker to mount their host 's /code/.
In Jenkins you no need to provide a mvn in goal execution.
/pre/  Now I want to move the entire C:\Jenkins\jobs directory to a new disk, what is the correct setting to use?
On our Jenkins node this is a problem as we do n't want these installed globally, not to mention, I do n't have root user privileges anyways.
I am trying to set Jenkins environment variables at runtime via the EnvironmentContributor.buildEnvironmentFor() method.
Additionally there are two Jenkins plugins that might be helpful: .
I see that the Kubernetes Plugin does not provide any option on the Jenkins UI to add the tolerations, as shown in the image below.
The agent is running as a dedicated user LOGON\jenkins.
So essentially I want Jenkins to be able to create a new volume from my snapshot and then attach this volume to an instance and boot it up.
I have a registered account with visual studio but problem is, jenkins runs as SYSTEM user and visual studio is NOT logged in with that user.
I have also made unsuccessful attempts to run Jenkins as Windows Service with checked Allow Service to interact with Desktop.
This is not possible in Jenkins build with parameters page.
For example, you could create a jenkins namespace and only allow privileged Pods to be created in the jenkins and kube-system namespaces and then prevent all users but cluster admins from execing into Pods in those namespaces.
I am trying to upload multiple patterns like .zip and .tar.gz using Artifactory/Jfrog Files in Jenkins.
I am using Jenkins Declarative syntax to define my pipeline.
In Jenkins-pipelines there is the concept of /url/,  where you can have parts of the pipeline extracted into another class to re-use in multiple other /code/ 's.
Case 1: Create a jenkins job which would act as a Template.
With this plugin, you can easily enable / disable / change / customize email section (and a lot more other actions) from jenkins manage (global section).
You can disable plugin if you rename it in specific way (JENKINS_HOME/plugins/PLUGIN_NAME.hpi.disabled).
You need to set the URL of jenkins correctly in /url/ .
You would also have a build system like Jenkins.
I am using Headless Chrome browser on jenkins .
The simplest way is to go to /code/ page in your Jenkins instance and approve the signature.
I want to use Jenkins and store the configuration and the pipeline in my SCM(e.g.
The check box "Use FTP over TLS" is enabled in the FTP host configuration (under Manage Jenkins > Configure system) and "Trusted Certificate" added.
Jenkins must have access to GIT repository, so you need to create credential to Git for him.
I am developing an application for which I would like continuous integration using Jenkins, furthermore I would like to be able to control the environment for CI.
I want to trigger this command via Jenkins.
We had to implement something that would do a get to the REST API for the /code/ before the call to the Jenkins /code/ url.
Once Jenkins is properly called, you can then, as mentioned in "/url/", use the "/url/", from /url/.
I want to create automated trigger from Jenkins.
Jenkins support AJAX based auto-completion with automated control population.
Use /code/ to execute your task from Jenkins.
How would I do it if I want my Jenkins instance abstracted?
I want to integrate our Rest API with Jenkins, is there any way to do that or any plugin available in Jenkins?
The user would have to be able to log into Jenkins, to go where the job page is, and to just click something there to say ‘stop’.
If you not admin of this Jenkins you have no option but to ask your admin a permissions - that  's the sandbox for.
The Jenkins test job does not allow concurrent builds.
I have set /code/ and /code/ to my jenkins user in /code/(in my case it 's the admin user) and I can see /code/ var fetches values when I do  .
In Jenkins, I set up my application like this: /url/ /url/ .
The idea we started exploring screwdriver is to connect our existing jenkins jobs to better show in good UI like screwdriver which provides feature called "Pipeline".
Does screwdriver really allows to invoke external jenkins or we need to create jenkins via docker for every job execution ?
I am using Jenkins v2.107.1.
I want to execute a transition in JIRA via Jenkins.
It allows you to create another container stored data from volumes from jenkins container.
Also you are free to update, remove jenkins container.
I 'm really not looking for specific Jenkins plugins or stuff, but rather, from a security and architecture standpoint, what 's the best approach to accomplish this?
/pre/  I want that jenkins will trigger a build only in the module that has been changed.
How can i use the test results with a tool like jenkins?
in order to parse them into an xunit xml test files that can be used by tools like jenkins, we need to use an external logger named /url/.
The solution turned out to be not to use PowerShell 's remoting at all, but instead rely on the remoting built into Jenkins: .
I 'm using a custom docker image for my Jenkins build.
/pre/  You need to create a Jenkins credentials object which will contain the credentials for the repository and give it a name to replace /code/ above.
I have a Jenkins master with two build agents out of which one is a Windows box and the other is a Mac.
In my case, I observed a similar  'retrying' problem when trying to push to GCR in various ways, having installed Jenkins on GKE per Google Cloud Services /url/.
The reason behind this is to provide highest possible security when running Jenkins builds.
If all methods were available by default, users could run malicious scripts that break other builds or Jenkins server in general.
I have developed few functions in NodeJS and would like to use Jenkins to do some testing on it and then deploy it to Azure.
Specifically, I would like to know if there are any examples of testing done on Azure functions using Jenkins.
I used variables to use curl as showed in picture and it works fine, but I don´t know how to hide user and pass on jenkins output job.
I am trying to execute the following stages using Jenkins Pipeline as a code in Continuous Delivery format.
Should I be using some other Jenkins trick to share files between different jobs/pipelines?
Using withCredentials does not expose them in Jenkins logs .
So without Jenkins Pipeline the Naginator Plugin allows to restart a specific build on failure using regular expressions.
Goto Manage Jenkins>>Configure System>>Advanced .
My company is using Jenkins for their CI and so far we 've only been using it for our web apps, but now we 're getting to the windows service apps we use and I 'm looking for some guidance on this.
I need Jenkins to run it as admin so that windows will allow the script to toggle the services.
Create a simple python program(factorial), then load/add it in git-hub, then i need to run it through Jenkins when I make change in that python program and add it again in git-hub.Then send the reports to mail.
I 'm in a situation where I do n't have the Performance plug-in fully enabled in the Jenkins box I 'm running my tests in, so I 'm using the jmeter-maven-plugin for running the JMeter tests and I intend to use the (Jenkins) performance plug-in for showing the results on the job page.
Newer Jenkins versions also allow to read the jobs XML configuration via the user interface.
/pre/  Alternatively, you can also check at jenkins job level.
2- Add an extra step in your /code/ to give jenkins the right permissions to use docker: .
Our Jenkins server is located in Germany so that we want to see European time in Jenkins.
click on application specific password >> give the name of the application in the drop down as Jenkins (google by default does not have any specific application password setting for Jenkins) >> this will generate password note down the password generated .
I 'm creating a Jenkins pipeline using Blue ocean.
I am trying to pull a repository using Jenkins, by default Jenkins create a long and unreadable workspace name.
I already searched for a solution and changed the user from Jenkins to the admin: .
You can use /url/ in order to publish /url/ and response graph in Jenkins.
Additionally, you can try /url/ for /url/ testing as it provides integration with Jenkins and will help you to keep your performance testing report on a single platform.
So far I 've been using the plot plugin post-build option on Jenkins to do this but would like to automate it.
If it is good , jenkins has to fetch cookbook from github and push it to DEV/QA.. etc based on user input ( parameter build) and run the kitchen tests in the server and publish the results via jenkins email plugin.
Then I drop privileges to the /code/ user to launch Jenkins.
So I 've customized the Jenkins Dockerfile to look like this... .
/pre/  And have an entry in my sudoers file for the jenkins user.
/pre/  Jenkins container seems to be green.
You dont need to look from the jenkins side.
And then you need to configure in jenkins like a build trigger /url/ .
I have divided feature files into different functional areas and they are in turn represented as separate Jenkins jobs.
I have also some unit tests made with TAP, shown in Jenkins with another plugin.
Delete Jenkins (there will be a /code/ user with /code/ username for the first time when jenkins is installed) from "Users &amp; Groups" .
Jenkins) from being able to perform critical tasks.
In Jenkins you have the option to /code/ and /code/ files, sort of like uploading and downloading artifacts that are not visible to the user.
In my Jenkins instance I use shared libraries.
This is for Jenkins where I do n't want the Jenkins user as a Github admin but I want it to add 1 to the build number (which for iOS happens to be in the info.plist) commit + push it as part of our build process.
If I add the jenkins user (nickm01 below) to the "allowed to push to branch" list, that user still seems to have to create a pull request to push a commit.
Unfortunately our jenkins user "nickm01" still has to create a PR in order to push changes.
Then above line can be specified in tomcat-users.xml --> your just giving access permission to jenkins with the user who has the following privileges   .
Im trying to use Jenkins shared library with inner classes.
I 'm trying to write tests for my Job DSL code using jenkins-test-harness.
I have a requirement in Jenkins pipeline where in after the successful build I need an user input to proceed or abort.
My issue how to get current logged user of Jenkins so that I can validate the user and carry on with deployment.
First, you have to know I ca n't and do n't want to use automatic signing because I have loads of existing provisioning profiles, I 'm using jenkins, ca n't risk to break something while there 's not a lot of documentation on ionic / cordova / push notifications and automatic signing.
You have to switch it on MANUALLY which is a right pain when you build from jenkins.
I 'm using Jenkins Pipeline Declarative Syntax, the problem is that I could n't find a way to declare tools for a specific /code/.
And if you want to do this in Jenkins, I can suggest /url/ .
hi i 'm creating docker image, i need to automatically open jenkins page in browser, for that i need to place my host system 's(windows) ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys.
Stop Jenkins server : Go to Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Administrative Tools\Services search for Jenkins and stop it .
I want to show Jenkins status badges on a locally hosted webpage served with CGIHTTPServer from python 2.7. .
Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes .
In a Jenkins job config 's Build Triggers section, it is possible to add multiple cron expressions separated on each line in the Schedule textarea e.g:  .
I find Jenkins most reasonable, because you have out-of-the box support for test reports, notifications, etc.
Another problem, we dont want users that editing the Jenkinsfile put any credentialsId but use the one that defined in the Jenkins job step under "SCM definitions".
Once you manage to do this all you need to do is to "write that line" in jenkins.
Of course you need to create jenkins credentials with the aforementioned username and password.
I just take it from another jenkins job (named test) manually when I : .
One thing you have to be aware is that your Jenkins test run by a Jenkins agent will use "Jenkins" user.
This might require a custom job (jenkins/VSTS/VM) etc.
I need advice from everyone, is it possible to create a jenkins job which prepares build from git tag (not from branch).
I 'm trying to set up Jenkins security using the Google Login plugin (v1.3).
An alternative would be to let me go to a standard username/password page if I do n't log in via Google, but I 'd need to have a Google redirect me to a page other than the Jenkins home page (which takes me straight back to Google auth) .
I want to configure my mail to jenkins so that I can get mail regarding all builds.
However, i wanted to achieve the same using the Allure Jenkins plugin.
I am not sure, but either you didnt understood what the jenkins is for, or you are using not proper name convetions.
Jenkins is configured to use active directory/ldap to enable all my colleagues to login with their credentials .
the best solution is to set your project on Jenkins, then use trigger automatically and add 'cron pattern' to schedule as you want.
I have created the .jmx scripts for performance testing and I tried to run through those scripts using GUI mode and NOn-GUI mode in the local system using command window and Jmeter tool and it worked fine.But I want to run this scripts in Jenkins remotely using GitHub.
The first approach would be to allow Jenkins to connect to the database.
I 'm using Jenkins to execute my automation tests.
I was not able to open the jenkins dashboard on 9090 port.
I 'm trying to use the /code/ add in with Jenkins Job DSL to conditionally trigger a build step.
You really do n't want to store credentials (or any sensitive secret, really) in Jenkins.
I have Jenkins scripted pipeline with multiple stages, all of the stages require the same password for interaction with third-party API.
I have tried running the command as the root user, and as the jenkins user, but get the same result.
/pre/  Is there a way to see the list of all such Jenkins APIs?
I 'm currently trying to display the plot of an /code/ file in Jenkins by using a /code/.
I have connected Jenkins to our LDAP server in order to manage permissions for users and groups via the security matrix.
Current LDAP configuration in Jenkins finds group membership via: .
/pre/  When I add an LDAP group to the matrix, it shows the group icon next to the group-name (meaning it found the group in LDAP), but when users that are members of that group log in to Jenkins, they only have Anonymous permissions.
/pre/  How can I get the members in the LDAP group and get these LDAP groups working in Jenkins?
/pre/  I set up a simple Jenkins job (same machine, same user) that just clones my repo and runs the script .
So I had to go to "Jenkins/Credentials" menu and enter credentials there.
Actually it will be the same, you will just need to add a Jenkins build step in order to fetch the .jmx file from Github prior to running JMeter.
I need your help)  I need run appium test on ios real device in jenkins.
Following are the setting that I 've applied inside Manage Jenkins -> Configure System .
no dependency of the implementation of the specific requirements to jenkins, means can also be used without jenkins .
This Type of test case selection is also possible via Squish plugins for other build automation tools like Jenkins.
That will allow you to indicate, below the ssh URL of your GitHub repo (int he Jenkins job configuration page) which SSH key you are using for your credentials.
My problem is that, if I want to automatically trigger a new Jenkins job to take that deployable artifact and deploy it into an integration server and run functional tests then I imagine I would do something like this at the end of my Jenkinfile: .
However and because it 's a Multibranch pipeline, I would have to hardcode the Jenkins job I want to trigger which I really rather not do but I do n't know what else to try as I do n't think there would be another way to get the info I need to find the artifact to deploy (ID, version, name, etc.
dynamically adjusting group permissions of the jenkins user in an entrypoint.sh of the jenkins container, so you do n't need to change permissions of the docker socket or try to match the host group to the container group .
The last part I do with an entrypoint that runs as root, runs a /code/ to adjust the gid of the user 's group, and then drops permissions to that user with an /code/ + /code/ which replaces pid 1 with the jenkins server running as the jenkins user.
But you can set up Jenkins to poll codecommit .
You have to add the private key to the jenkins credential store and pass it to the command.
Defined the following environment variable via: Jenkins UI -> Manage Jenkins -> Configure System: .
/url/ plugin - provides a centralized way to define credentials that can be used by your Jenkins instance, plugins and build jobs.
I do n't know which plugins should I use on jenkins and how to configure them.
I 'm using Jenkins ver.
The temporary workaround runs Jenkins as root - I do n't advise production use unless you know what you 're doing and have full control of the code you are building.
There is a requirement in our project where we want to publish JUnit report in Jenkins but not for all test cases,only for some test cases those are following a naming convention.Note-:We do n't want to skip those test execution,we just do n't want to publish those test result in Jenkins.Please let me know if there is a way to achieve that.
So the JENKINS container, cannot create other container (here, the POSTGRES container) .
Essentially, what I would like to have is something similar to /url/, but between Jenkins' nodes.
You need to configure the Jenkins server to be able to run the script "normally" but you will always have to add the credentials.
To enable remote   Windows machine in to the WS-Man trusted list on Jenkins servers.
There are all kinds of long term solutions of course such as TopShelf, AdvancedInstaller, WIX etc with nice Jenkins plugins but for now it would be nice if I could make this work.
I am new to Jenkins and it would be helpful anyone could provide some inputs on this.
Maybe the box where you 're running the agent does have enough memory available, but the Jenkins agent is just not using it.
Say if you do that using AWS, you can assign tags like email into the provisioned instance, that way if a user tries to run another provision job but with an existing resource already allocated(or is being allocated), Jenkins has a way to query AWS via API to not proceed with the build.
If unsure, consider using the "Pipeline Syntax" > "Sample Step" > "step: General Build Step" and "Build Step" > "Squish" (requires the dedicated Squish plug-in for Jenkins, not the one that supports Hudson and Jenkins).
I am currently trying to understand why Jenkins is not sending emails.
Or is there any other way in Jenkins (perhaps using Artifactory RestAPI) to add properties to the artefact before uploading to Artifactory?
I needed to configure Jenkins on a CentOS box via Puppet using the /url/ module.
/pre/  So looks like by following items 1 and 2 above I was able to run ansible tasks via Jenkins job and view report from ARA.
I do n't want to put our SSL certificate inside code repository for jenkins to use it.
Once you 've created build tasks that distinguish between different test groupings, you can define your Jenkins pipeline stages like so: .
The problem is that I want to create a simple Dockerfile, that can create a Docker image with a Jenkins master with everything I want it to contain.
I 'm able to get rid of the initial "hello welcome to jenkins"-thing, and define my first user + install plugins that i wrote down in a text file.
I 'm trying to use nginx container which will be used to port forwarding communication to other containers such as Ansible/GIT/Jenkins etc ....  .
As far as I know it is possible to trigger a Jenkins build on a push to GitLab.
I want to set up Jenkins for a decent build chain for a JavaFX application that controls a robotic arm and other hardware: .
Unit and Integration tests use JUnit and can run on the Jenkins master, for the System tests we use TestNG and they can run the TestFX tests on a Jenkins agent.
My question would be: what is the best way to set this up in Jenkins?
Easy to maintain Jenkins flow .
Can any one let me know is there a possibility that i can see all the list of steps that are involved in build and release can be seen in a pipeline view in VSTS (Same as the pipeline view in jenkins ?
Since Jenkins is running using launchd, I had to copy the Jenkins user 's certificates from the "login" keychain into "System".
We are using jenkins in our premises, trying to trigger a job-c after job-a and job-b builds successfully completed.

I am trying to get all the builds of a jenkins job though rest api GET /code/,  .
I am using as well single trunk development, so I have a /code/ branch and that is the one I set upon the restrictions, My webhook is configured in consequence to react to push events on that branch, thus triggering the hook and hopefully the Jenkins build.
I 'd like to use Jenkins to run some unit tests that use the local elasticsearch.
I 'm using the Kubernetes Jenkins plugin in order to create Jenkins slaves on demand.
Build pre-baked slave images using Chef and something like /url/ and provide them to Jenkins Amazon EC2 plugin .
As I am using the jenkins plugin /code/ I will set this webhook to call the specific endpoint for it: .
And this is how my Job Looks Like, basically it will IGNORE all the commits made by a user with name "Jenkins" you can adjust this depending on your payload.
/code/ which is the regular expression that evaluates negatively to exclude that jenkins user .
You should ideally first see which tool is producing the reports and then add a plugin in jenkins for that .
I actually do n't want to upgrade Jenkins.
It is recommended to use java 8 with Jenkins 2.5.xx .
Add the ID of the user directly to the role and then restart Jenkins.
Yes, the Jenkins need to have access to dev project, you can use the following command to give access: .
Assuming this is the Jenkins Artifactory Plugin, you can use a file spec to define the properties that you want to upload (that is the 'props' element described in /url/).
As you can see this is configured within a /url/ so in a Jenkins job I can use it there exclusively.
There are different ways to run ARA with Jenkins.
This might be /code/ if you 're executing your /code/ command from the jenkins user, for example.
If you want to run the web application on your Jenkins server, you can do that too.
I am getting the following error while trying to install using jenkins user .
True, you cannot disable the project from Jenkins Job as multibranch pipeline does n't give control to change the settings from the job.
I am able to  execute PT from Jenkins on Blazemeter.
Now I want jenkins build number to show in blazemeter report.

As far as I know and to this date, it is not possible to add tolerations to jenkins 's slaves that are spinned up by the kubernetes plugin.
Note: I have granted Admin access to the API User (Jenkins) in Play Console.
/pre/  Since the Jenkins' linux user does n't need have access to ssh keys, simply lifting its permissions for this one command does the job.
I 'd like to select between different Gradle tasks to use when building an Android app on Jenkins.
Probably, what I am looking for is interacting directly with the JGit client of Jenkins, at which point I might just as well use /code/ commands... .
/pre/  I verified that /bin/bash is existing and the jenkins user has access to it.
/pre/  With these changes I can /code/ to the aws instance manually as the jenkins user from my linux with the command /code/, but I am not able to launch a jenkins node via ssh.
Just wanted to put my full solution here for seamlessly integrating /code/ / /code/ fields/properties with a MySQL 5.7 database (which does n't support /code/) - based on @matt-jenkins answer above: .
There are several ways to do this via Jenkins plugins: .
Ensure that you are able to access Jenkins by utilizing /code/.
I 'm trying to list folders containing a certain file on jenkins and use later this array.

   my Jenkins instance itself is launched through docker, by simply using something like docker run jenkins .
/Users/{USERNAME}/.jenkins/users/jenkins/config.xml .
Another option is to set ssh private key on Jenkins server to athenticate against Gitlab repo.
Jenkins Gitlab plugin is not officially supported and not well maintained because Gitlab wants customers to user their own CI/CD solution in order to tie customers to their platform for marketing reasons.
I updated the Jenkins users token.
other option is to have several runs of jenkins job and use shell script pwd locate where are you and ls to see what you have there and it will give you idea how to proceed.
I know there is a sonar-gitlab plugin but it requires to use Gitlab-CI runners and I do n't want to use additional slaves on gitlab runners and it was pointless for me then to make a job in Jenkins that can analyze projects in the first place.
Although the correct PATH environment variable is available when SSH'ing to it with the same user, it 's not available when Jenkins tries to use the agent for building.
I know I have to set two settings; one in 'Manage Jenkins' > 'Configure System' > 'SonarQube Servers' and another (i.e.
And, now want to trigger auto build in jenkins when gitbucket receive a new commit, according to: /url/ .

It is used in the visualization in the /code/ in a job overview page (Jenkins UI).
This is not nice: in my previous life I used Jenkins, where I could easily maintain different CI-setups outside of the actual repo (I totally do get that GitLab solves the problem of having the CI-config itself under version control).
I 'm trying to get a setup where Gitea and Jenkins are running in separate Docker containers and set up a simple pipeline.
I have already added the Jenkins generated key to my Git user profile.

I want to create a job in Jenkins that will run after a merge request is created.
On the left sidebar of the main Jenkins UI, click Credentials > System > Add domain .
I personally recommend creating a new user on the remote Jenkins and generating an API token and using that here, but you could also just generate an API token for your own user.
From the main Jenkins page click Manage Jenkins > Configure System, then scroll down to the Parameterized Remote Trigger Configuration section and click Add.
Open an existing Jenkins job or create a new one, scroll down to the Build section, and add the build step Trigger a remote parameterized job: .
These are then built with parameters on the Jenkins where radio buttons decide whether to stop or start.
Turns out that the way to go for using plots with Groovy code in Jenkins is with a Pipeline project.

I would like to keep this behavior because this guarantees if someone changes the configuration of MongoDB, Jenkins, etc.
If you look at Manage Jenkins->Configure Global Security, you can see that you can select only one security realm.
I would say, for Jenkins use create a github service account specifically that user can be restricted to just a few repositories.
Turns out that the way to go for using plots with Groovy code in Jenkins is with a Pipeline project.
How can I add a limited access account for jenkins automation when I 'm using Global GitHub OAuth Settings?
I 'm using GitHub OAth for login to jenkins and I have python jenkinsapi scripts that I want to run as a user with read only access.
I can create a github account without access to my repositories and then limit that accounts access to jenkins but this seems cumbersome.
It seems that when jenkins contains a local user, that the plugin uses this first (/url/) .
Note: I know about tools like Jenkins/TeamCity which probably can do this, but as of now I am looking for a solution without them.
You can verify this if you go to Manage Jenkins -> Configure Global Security.
You wo n't be able to use any jenkins cookbook resources if you use remote option since that is disabled in settings.

We need a Jenkins job to trigger on a Git code push, simple enough.
Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Extended E-mail Notification .
You can use Jenkins API for remote trigger of Job.

So ca n't use ssh protocol in jenkins job 's /code/ under /code/.
/pre/  So they have three options on the drop down, but it would be nice if when they select the "custom" choice jenkins pops an input box to type in raw user input.
I do n't want to use user input during the pipeline run because that means they need to choose custom then wait for jenkins to get to the stage where it asks them for input.
That way you dont have to link the container, then your jenkins spawned container connect to that on the exposed port on the host.
You could also use jenkins to spin up the container within rancher, using the rancher cli.
I assume that you have used the initial admin password to unlock the new Jenkins server.
Double-check the environment settings after executing your job in Jenkins: you might see differences with the same environment settings as seen with your user account in command-line (where it is working) .
I have a very simple build on Windows Jenkins that should execute a shell command.
If you dont want to use a Jenkins pipeline job refer /url/ link .
I am an admin on our Jenkins master but, this button is not available for any builds for any user.

There are multiple jobs on the jenkins server that are built pulling from this particular repo and I need a way to make sure that for every new commit, a build is triggered in the jenkins jobs.
There are several best practices when setting up Jenkins and as well as using Jenkins for you CI/CD pipeline.
I 'm trying to write a jenkins file that will allow me to have a non-blocking input step (i.e.
Go to Manage Jenkins -> Manager Pluins  -> Advanced  .
I 'm running with /code/ , and /code/ I obviously do n't want the jenkins job to work using root, we all know that 's not right.
All I had to do was store my creds in Jenkins and use them in the Git setup.
I am trying to create a Jenkins job, where the Job iterates through an array of values.
/pre/  Trying to create cluster in aws using kube-aws up via jenkins but getting an error .
You are the only one included by default because Jenkins knows you enabled the role strategy.
I use Jenkins for building my program.
Basically I am going to create a build job which could be triggered by more than 1 people so I want the user/admin who has logged in to Jenkins to provide his credntials for perforce.
Now I want to do it in Java to integrate that with Jenkins.
The user credentials used for checking out sources from perforce are distinct from those used for logging in to Jenkins.
By enabling project based security for a Jenkins job you can configure which users (that is users logged in to Jenkins, which could be authenticated via LDAP) are allowed to trigger a job.
IMHO it is wise to a have a dedicated Jenkins/build user in perforce, so that all jobs in Perforce use that p4-user for building any job.
I am trying to generate job using jenkins JOB-DSL and i am unable to find a way to trigger allure report as publisher in freestylejob  .
On our Jenkins instance we are using a mix of plugins where JobDSL API is available for a few and not available for others due to which we are having to create these using the configure option.
Is there any way to send the test result dashboard directly to the email using jenkins?
How to create Jenkins job dynamically using DSL(I 'm not aware of DSL) .
I am using jenkins pipeline 2.0, and I would like to get another job 's latest successful build number.
use the XRay Jenkins plugin : /url/ .
/pre/  The credential I am using has a valid private key and works fine when I use the library via Jenkins Settings.
We use CURL and trigger the Jenkins job, in the component configuration there is an option to "Run Process after a Version is Created", hope this helps .
Give R/w permissions to your Jenkins user .
See /url/ article for more information regarding adding performance tests under Jenkins control    .
However, I added a pull request via the AWS CodeCommit user interface and it did n't show up in Jenkins.
I am trying to attach the template file using Jenkins pipeline, emailext.
Since the git credentials are stored in the Jenkins Credential Plugin, I have access to a git username/password combination.
I need to create perforce clients from my jenkins build scripts, and this needs to be done unattended.
Right now each time I create a unique jenkins job, I have to manually create a perforce client for that job - I can do this from the command line, but Perforce also insists on pausing the client creation to show me the specification settings file, which I need to manually close before the client is created.
For example you can use Jenkins pipeline.
Now I want to star the Jenkins server, how to do that?
I do n't know the ALM REST API, but it sounds like you want to use a normal HTTP-session using cookies, but through Jenkins' /code/.
if you are using webdriver which does not require UI (for example google chrome headless) then there should be some miss configuration in jenkins side, therefor to help you figure it out you need to provide more details .
while using on Linux OS then,just perform steps given below:- Edit your default jenkins file using sudo because it 's read only file.
5) From Jenkins I am not able to run GUI commands.
Because I 've also Jenkins and Sonar containers for example, I just want to change the way to have persistent data.
Is There any way to add multiple keys for ssh connection for different server using Jenkins?
We are currently running a Jenkins master with multiple slave nodes, each of which is currently tagged with a single label (e.g., /code/, /code/, ...) .
Question: How can i define multiple labels (and-combined) based on which a node gets selected in a Jenkins scripted pipepline script?
Jenkins generates key pair and asks you to upload it to git .
I am trying to implement CI/CD pipeline for my set of microservices by using Kubernetes HA cluster and Jenkins.
Is it possible to make Jenkins use an SSL client certificate for the calls it makes towards those endpoints residing behind that load balancer?
We are running Jenkins declarative pipeline in parallel for diversity testing scenarios and using serenity to generate testing reports.
But after I used "docker.inside" from Jenkins Pipeline which does the user id handling auto-magically, I decided to build a Python 3 package based on docker-py to do this in a (hopefully) similar way (with some extended features I found helpful): .
Those sub/submodules are configured to be cloned using /code/ but my Jenkins must use /code/.
With one job I try to connect from my Dashboard (which stands behind the proxy) to a Jenkins component (which is outside of the company).
And I want to pass the proxy with /code/, so that the Dashboard can grab some information from Jenkins.
The Authentication Token is defined in Jenkins as a Credential, as I do n't want this token hard-coded, and checked into SCM.
/pre/  After that you can add the operations in jenkins jobs; to close the same appilcation use : .
For jenkins, I am using the Visual Basics script and using this loading perticular configration file.
/pre/  After that you can add the operations in jenkins jobs; to close the same appilcation use : .
I am trying to use it as a slave for my Jenkins.
I have a use case where I want to trigger a specific Jenkins job from a BitBucket pull-request via a webhook.
/pre/  After that you can add the operations in jenkins jobs; to close the same appilcation use :  .
But since currently , I 'm only using GitHub Organization projects on Jenkins due the massive amount of repositories that  we have , its possible to change the context message via declarative pipeline?
This allows me to consruct a tmp vars file when running the playbook via jenkins.. but also allow prompting on the command line .
You can create tests with JMeter and then use Jenkins Performance plugin to display results.
Go to Jenkins console and applythe following commands depending on the kind of CSP policies relaxation that you want.
I am using jenkins image to run on docker container.
I 'm doing this because I use jenkins in container.
So I copied the jar that I want to add via an Execute shell step in Jenkins, like this: .
/pre/  if use the same command from the command prompt (i.e Windows CMD) the job is getting triggered, but from the Jenkins job it is not working.
While the jenkins job is running it is asking for credential like: [sshexec] Enter password for datasource user .
The plugin perhaps is written to take advantage of using a node and the jenkins  'steps' this includes.
If you 're like my team then you like having user-friendly parameterized Jenkins Jobs that pipeline scripts trigger in stages, instead of maintaining all that declarative/groovy soup.
add the user jenkins to the below file .
In configuring jobs page of Jenkins there is an option "Build periodically" you need to specify CRON like settings.
I want to run the JMeter application relevant script with help of HP ALM and later want to integrate with Jenkins.
If your using the Jenkins artifactory plugin, this grants access to the Jfrog Cli which enables use of uploadSpec and downloadSpec.
credentialsid -> replace to your right credentials id that you created Google Service Account from private key in jenkins.
I would like to keep branches # under 15 to be displayed in Jenkins.
2) I tried to use "Orphaned Item Strategy" in declarative pipeline, but it only will delete "builds" on certain branch rather than the branch itself from Jenkins view.
I am new to Jenkins and Declarative pipeline - maybe there is a good way to solve?
In the new Jenkins Pipeline, under Build Triggers, select the checkbox Trigger builds remotely (e.g., from scripts).
(I do n't want to make any configurations in jenkins.)
I 'm using Jenkins 2.118 in Windows 7.
Now what I want to do is, once the build is in progress and if i manually abort the jenkins build with the [x] button,  /url/  I need to stop the automation job and kill the child exe 's.
I have used Jenkins using Command prompt earlier.
/pre/  I only want to execute it at specific builds, so that not all debug builds on my pc increase the number but only the builds done by jenkins change the buildnumber.
I was looking for an open source vulnerability and security scanner for scanning all the images on the private registry also I want to install the tool on the linux box and also integrate with Jenkins.
My point is to make a list in jenkins automation and make it to return list of connections in a checkbox.
For doing this, the Jenkins instance must be in the AWS itself if we are trying to add an IAM role, if not we need to add aws credentials.
Also use xvfb plugin in Jenkins.
As a jenkins user from aix command line I manage to run: .
The tool I am searching for should not only act as a sort of backup, but should allow us to reconfigure TFS simply launching a CLI command (like jenkins job builder 's /code/ command).
Create user 'jenkins' on docker host with UID:GID 1000:1000.   .
I 'm using Jenkins since a little moment now, but I wanted to do something and I ca n't find how to do it... .
For running tests from Jenkins - there are too many possible options depending on your build toolchain, the most basic use case - /url/ and /url/ you just need to add /url/ build step and put your command to kick off a JMeter test there.
Now i want to start using docker to update ALL containers with the new codebase using post commit hooks via Jenkins.
we had similar problem with versioning maven, so the solution for us was that we created two separate Jenkins Jobs and we do not use buildnumber-maven-plugin (do not get me wrong , may we did also wronge configuration of plugin, but the fact is that we did not manage to use it in way we want)  .
(in Jenkins) without usinf filereadet etc .
Uploads using a curl command or via the Artifactory plugin in Jenkins work without any problems.
Now, Jenkins provides /code/.
I am trying to add new node in Jenkins.
I 'd like to make a /code/ with another Jenkins on it with the same configuration and jobs as the existing Jenkins.
So basically my goal is to entirely copy the existing Jenkins instance 's functionality.
What is the easiest way to move existing Jenkins configurations and jobs to make the new instance behave like the old one?
Go to Jenkins → Manage Jenkins → Configure System and check for SSH Remote hosts and give the hostname, number and add the username and password of remote hosts .
I want to know why this is happening in jenkins .
I am using Jenkins in a big project, to do Continuous Integration (CI) among other things.
Ideally it would be straight to Jenkins like so: /code/ > /code/ > /code/ > /code/ .
I am trying to make our Jenkins setup more secure, but I am unable to protect artifacts with the /code/ option.
This would allow you to fetch data, alter page DOM, etc.. to customize the Jenkins workflow or display.
I can see it in browser but want it to print in jenkins.
when I build the image and run it(still I have many things to do), I need to type IP and port on my browser to open Jenkins dashboard.
However, I cant use SSH Plugin as it is a Corporate Jenkins(Multi-Tenanted).
Currently, I am creating a user for the remote machine with the SSH keys by using the 'My Credentials' section of Jenkins and adding the same credentials in the Jenkins Build Environment by checking 'SSHAgent' checkbox.
I am using Jenkins-2.89.3.
I want to receive an alert of some kind to Jenkins with the details of the change.
As it turned out, if you have a working custom Jenkins Plugin, there is little that needs to be done.
It 's technically possible to pull files from Perforce without creating a tracked workspace, and you could technically rewrite the Jenkins plugin to do this, but practically speaking that 's like surfing Wikipedia via /code/ because you do n't want to clutter your desktop by installing a browser.
That gets the job done, but it seems like a hack, and I 'm not such a huge fan of Jenkins.
EDIT: I want to find jobs from outside of Jenkins, via user interface or REST API, not from a pipeline.
It is not best practice to use Docker with Jenkins.
Jenkins is a Continuous Integration Server, which is a fancy way of saying "a service that builds stuff at various times, according to predefined rules" .
Finally, running Jenkins inside a docker container just means you need to bind your Docker-ized Jenkins to the external world, as @yamenk indicates, or you 'll have trouble launching builds.
The most common approach to this is to use a CI/CD tool, like Jenkins or CircleCI.
Use the jenkins build step.
is the ClearCase elements you need to fill out in order for Jenkins to: .
I would like to set a parameter in Jenkins Declarative Pipeline enabling the user to select one of the jobs defined on Jenkins.
They look the similar way in Jenkins .
However if you still want to go for the separation: The git/checkout steps will usually have the possibility to add a hook in Jenkins so the job will get triggered automatically on changes.
When you go to your Jenkins job you should be able to view the workspace.
Under the "General" tab of the Jenkins job in the jenkins web app, you must select the checkbox labeled "This project is parameterized" and then create String Parameters (one of the available types of parameters once this check box is selected) which you are trying to pass values to.
So if we are pulling image from image registry, Then why we again using automated Docker image build within Jenkins?
If this is a alternative option, what is the difference between image pulling and automated image building in Jenkins?
I saw similar kinda issue here but most of the places solution was to change Jenkins security configuration but in my case that 's not the option.
Jenkins using it 's own user /code/ so if your issue is only to have Jenkins able to login to server, I would suggest to add user Jenkins to the group you mentioned.
I 'm not seeing any option to "Delete All Disabled Modules" in my Jenkins.
/pre/  We can use this under Jenkins pipeline script to achieve above requirement .
I am not using Jenkins at this case.
Yes, the fastest way to have it done is use master/slave setup for you jenkins.
Yes it is possible, either by using slack webhook api directly either using 3rd party tools like Jenkins Slack plugin.
I 'm using Jenkins to build my WAR/EAR to a windows server.Everything works fine.i.e I can push my files on the server using my username,But what I want is to Create a group so that everyone in that group can push the code into the server not only me, In case I leave the organisation then the above needs to be changed instead if a group is allowed then, this wont be an issue anymore.
So my question is I have a group created on the windows server with the people needed to have access,But how do I login into the server using that group or better yet how do I mention that in Jenkins so that Jenkins has access to that group.
It is done through Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security > TCP port for JNLP agents.
Go to Jenkins --> Manage Jenkins --> Configure Global Security .
Set permission for Anonymous User to Read / Write Jenkins Jobs.
You can use jenkins to integrate robot and testlink.
Basically, you 'll have to obtain TC names from a testplan in jenkins job and feed robot with those in any way (e.g.
Now, Set username and password - Here, You are good to go and use jenkins.
/pre/   Since my jenkins user does not have the admin/ sudo privileges I used a workaround, I added users/&lt; username >/.gem to my environment variable path in jenkins, .
Add a userNavigate to Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> Configure Global Security.
Add Credentials If you added a user that is not known to LDAP you need to create the credentials in Jenkins (i.e.
Navigate to Jenkins -> Credentials -> System -> Global Credentials -> Add Credentials  Then add username and password.

If I am following this style, how I can create and launch different images from same code repository using Jenkins?
Is possible to launch multiple images using Jenkins from same code repository?
please guide how to generate html report, i am using newman-jenkins.
here are the following commands we use on Jenkins: .
Another idea could be to go through chkconfig, and remove Jenkins: .
In that case, Jenkins would n't need to know how to build this or download modules etc.
Is there a way to use both LDAP and Jenkins user database?
Give the /code/ user (or whatever account Jenkins is running with) ownership to /code/ folder using /url/ command like: .
But for this OP, what specific syntax will enable Jenkins to extract the commit hash?
I suspect that the user you are testing with on the box and the user that Jenkins runs as are two different users, so the initial key exchange has never happened for the Jenkins user and Jenkins is headless so it has no ability to type yes to accept the host identification key.
I have an application in Agular 4.3 and I using Jenkins to do continuous delivery.
I have been trying to do CI using Jenkins for my Android application.
This means that in order to access a git repository on host A from Jenkins running inside a container on host A, you would need to expose that git repository in some way, usually via HTTP or SSH.
I want to trigger jenkins job when a new Docker-image is builds in DockerHub in a specific tag.
I have tried various combinations of bsIosBuildId but its not accepting a value from Jenkins.
I am trying to transfer all .sh files from one unix server to another using jenkins.
I have a Jenkins, which is integrated with AD, using Global Security.
This is just top level overview, since details depend a lot on your actual setup, permissions, git policies, type of Jenkins configuration etc.
I am trying to build a jenkins pipeline where I have a choice parameter with n choices and want to create a /code/ which does something when some values from the choice parameter are selected I have something like below but does n't seem to work.
If the most recent build failed, we want Jenkins to ignore that build and test using a previous build that passed.
Override the /etc/hosts file of your Jenkins (I really do n't like too much) and play with the host name.
Rather, I need help/guidance on how to access the changeset at a repo level using Jenkins Shared Library.
Generally, it 's a good idea to keep your Jenkins machine as clean as possible, therefore you should avoid installing extra packages on it like Terraform.
A better approach for this problem would be creating a Dockerfile with your Terraform binary and all the plugins that you need already built-in, then all you need to do in your Jenkins pipeline is build and execute your Terraform docker.
/pre/  But is Jenkins the one who has the permissions, I want to assign the permissions to my azureuser .
I want to enable new Jenkins slave instances on demand.
Now, the trouble is that we are unable to use the 'Bash on Ubuntu on Windows' from Jenkins.
May be we need to modify some windows environment variable to force jenkins to use this shell.
/pre/  But, since you do not have administrator rights for jenkins, you can implement something like this: .
when i submit the command in terminal i was using the user as ubuntu but jenkin uses the user as "jenkins".
If you use Jenkins it is easy to put a job once per month to do the above.
it will enable you to ssh without password from jenkins box to remote host.
No matter what options I use to the Jenkins git plugin it always pulls down all branches: .
What I 'd like to do is to use Jenkins for managing GPU resources and queueing jobs accordingly, i.e.
/url/ im redirected to Jenkins page  I did the first steps of creating login , Now when I go to my MANAGE PLUGIN SECTION.
A bit another use-case, but if you are using Jenkins you can set the /code/ flag and Jenkins will do it for you.
We bootstrap jobs onto our Jenkins 2 server using JobDSL (/code/), and define their steps using Jenkinsfiles.
Also i could see for a jenkins job Started by user xyz Started by user xyz Started by user xyz Started by user xyz Started by user xyz Started by user xyz Started by user xyz  for a single build .
We use Jenkins for CI.
The user that Jenkins is running under has full domain-admin access.
Plus Jenkins is a web app so you can access it from many devices!
IN jenkins I have a requuirment that before applying git merge I need to perform a git rebase.
SO, do I need to write script for this or is there any option in jenkins which I can apply to do git rebase before git merge?
I did this in my Dockerfile which creates my Jenkins instance like so: .
is there a way to create a custom task to restart apache server and invoke that task using a Jenkins job?
I want to get the file to attach it in an email, using Jenkins and send it.

I have setup Jenkins server and want to run Appium on it so there are 2 ways: .
I want to run a simple npm -v command via a Jenkins.
You can use /url/ or /url/ or similar in order to verify connectivity, given you will be able to establish connection to the database from Jenkins host or build agent - JMeter should also be able to connect and execute queries (assuming you have appropriate /url/ in /url/)  .
I have a stage in Jenkins declarative pipeline that I want to run conditionally when manually triggered, and only on the /code/ branch.
We have a CI jenkins platform and we want to manage our deployments with an email confirmation.
I currently have some UI tests running in Jenkins using headless Chrome.
jenkins job Started by user xyz Started by user xyz Started by user   xyz Started by user xyz Started by user xyz Started by user xyz   Started by user xyz for a single build .
If you do n't want to use the Jenkins plugin and want to timeout a script or any command then you can use the Linux inbuilt utility "timeout".
I am using the active choices jenkins plugin.
So I am using Jenkins and building an application with c#.
I am currently using the "Poll SCM" option in Jenkins with the poll frequency set to 1 minute for now.
I 'm newly implementing TeamCity and earlier was using Jenkins to implement CI.
We use Jenkins for running data science experiments (experiment = jenkins build).
The jupyter service then creates -at the node it is running on- a localhost webserver on a a specific port ... and I want this web-app output of the port displayed in jenkins->job->build ... meybe on a plugin 's page, i do not want to overwrite consoleoutput, of course) .
I need to use Webhooks to send notification to slack from jenkins.
In Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Global Properties you can define global Environment Variables which can be accessed from Jenkins jobs.
Bonus info: I 'm using Jenkins to assign the agents and orchestrate the build and NuGet Restore is invoked using Cake 's /url/ method, but I 'm able to reproduce using only 'nuget restore' from two separate terminals at the same time, so I 'm assuming the error does not lie with Jenkins or Cake, although solutions involving either will be welcome.

Why it does n't work for "UI-Jenkins".
I want to be able to add a callback as a parameter in a Jenkins Groovy script.
But that would make sense on a CI server like Jenkins.
I am trying to use Jenkins for my CI/CD but it is not working well for me.
AFAIK this is only possible for the whole of the Jenkins instance - not just for specific jobs.
So I’ve been seeing this trend to use docker to spin up Jenkins slaves and I have a doubt regarding the use of same.
Jenkins windows shell or batch command will use  'system' account to process git command and its ssh key setting is different form your gerrit plugin or login account.
With Jenkins I can connect to ubuntu instance using SSH key and can do everything, what 's I want.
Two possible ways of doing it is via the /url/ or by writing a few /url/ commands and call them from the Jenkins Shell.

I have configured private key authentication so that the user running jenkins (tomcat) can connect using a key and passphrase to the remote server as a user named jenkins.
Go to "Manage Jenkins" from the jenkins front page .
You can use Jenkins REST APIs.
Instead of using the Ansible plugin, I recommend doing the Jenkins way: .
It is not specific to DC/OS or Mesos, it 's just the way Jenkins works.
DC/OS and Mesos will make sure that Jenkins stays running and available to send jobs to, and in this way, it is "fault tolerant", but in the way you are asking about it is n't.
Linux server has just one user 'jonas' with sudo privilege, in addition to jenkins user.
Another similar solution is to use /code/ option in Jenkins.
A solution I see is to have a third party web-server which generates the form then remotely triggers the job, but I would rather use something available inside Jenkins, so that I would have access to Jenkins internals when rendering the form template (using Groovy).
On my Mac I have one user for development and the other one as a Jenkins slave and, for some reasons that do n't belong here, I need to use different Command Line Tools version for each user.
I have been given this 6 yo application that Im trying to automate using Jenkins.
You need to make sure with which account Jenkins is running on the Jenkins box:   .
If you do have the right /code/ private/public key, Jenkins must run with that user for ~ to reflect the right HOME.
I am pulling the repo down with a user and have a key in Jenkins using the Git plugin, but now lerna is running outside that plugin and needs ssh access to the repo and it 's not available at the user level.
To set up Jenkins I used /url/ helm chart.
Then I open a separate window to access the Jenkins tool for adding security exceptions, but nothing is queued up for automatic approval, and nothing allows me to manually enter the commands that need to be approved.
Jenkins does not support multi-container builds out of the box.
I used the /url/ to store my passphrase and username from GitHub (where I have 2-factor enabled) in this fresh Jenkins instance.
I 'm trying to delete a Jenkins view programmatically but my Jenkins job: .
You can use the API for Jenkins either via XML or via JSON.

I want to hook up the test to run using Jenkins.
However, I do n't want a separate Jenkins task to start the browser-sync server.
I would recommend Jenkins since it will let you do more customization as well as open source, means it is free to use.
How I can put s3 upload credentials to Jenkins file without using a binding plugin.

Recently my company has gone with Jenkins as its CI/CD solution, after trying a number of options.
Click on Manage Jenkins .
I want to fetch those remote files to my Jenkins workspace, to be able to edit them within the Jenkins machine.
I tried to implement it via shell scripts, but the connection is public-private key based and I really would like to have a clean solution within Jenkins.
Jenkins also can publish good report using the /url/.
There’s a Jenkins plugin that works with 1.565.3 and newer which can bypass the matrix-based authentication for triggering the build job.
This is also reflected in the "People" page on Jenkins web-interface, which before the attempted login only showed /code/, but after the attempted login shows: .
an other solution might be the use of the Jenkins - Amazon EC2 plugin.
In addition to that, you could also create your own docker registry and modify a small baseimage for your needs and use it as a build image for jenkins.
I would n't think that it would be impossible to run tests on an already existing project with the jenkins, but this is ablosutly not the way how to do it.
Ideally, you want to have a Jenkins pipeline checked in.
I am trying to get the browser type in Jenkins.If then how can we pass it to the automation script to run .
For that you have to go to Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Extended E-mail Notification.
Configure it on Jenkins side (under Manage Jenkins -&gt; Configure Global Security -&gt; TCP port for JNLP agents and then fixed port number) as well as open it on AWS ECS side.
I am trying to build a Docker image for my application and push it out to Google Container Registry using Jenkins pipeline.
/pre/  And i supply /code/ as a jenkins parameter when using it in the jenkinsfile.
The reason we had to use Jenkins as a service is because, of Network Group Policy and there is no way we can ask Jenkins to run from Command Prompt.
Actually am using Jenkins 2.107.3, I want to know whether this version supports Java 1.8 or not..??
You can simply use the "Disable Project" option from Jenkins 2.89.4 onward in order to disable the pipeline Jobs.
I came upon this question after trying to run Jenkins builder slaves in Fargate.

Using jenkins-x  .
I am trying to login into an instance and check if the file /code/ is not empty, then /code/ make build unstable using the jenkins pipeline (jenkinsfile)But that 's not working.
Your Jenkins service must be launched by an admin user.
Is it possible to make Jenkins run these when a build is triggered?
Any ideas on how to accomplish this two way interaction between Slack and Jenkins Pipeline?
I am using Docker containers for my builds and the /code/ variable of course points to the Jenkins user home (/code/), which can cause problems e.g.
The only problem is I am not able to see all the users and project role which were set in previous Jenkins server.
Any way of getting all the previous users in the new Jenkins?
I found out that Jenkins does n't seem to use those credentials: Under usage it says 'This credential has not been recorded as used anywhere.'
/pre/  I will use then "pathTag" later on as input for Jenkins plugin (Influxdb).
I am trying to find a way to inherit/override environment variables in jenkins jobs defined via jenkins-job-builder (jjb).
/pre/  How can i update these 2 fields according to inputs given from Jenkins.?
It makes sense looking at the console output, Jenkins looks like he tries to retrieve some of its own files using the job 's specified JDK (6), but I do n't really get why he needs to do so ?
You have given permission to your "USERNAME" to access EC2 not "JENKINS" user.
Jenkins has its own user called "jenkins" which you can observe in users folder, create the ssh key here and pass this to EC2 and everything should work fine :) .
For conformation, just ssh into the server using your username and give it a try with Jenkins username it will not work until you do it the above changes  .
The next step I want to do, is to integrate Jenkins.

I have 2 test classes in my project that I want to run through jenkins, each with a particular profile (because they have different set of dependencies).
I am unsure if I need to instruct Jenkins to do something different, or if I need to instruct AWS to unzip the file and use it.
The /code/  is what allow Jenkins to build the job in, you know, any agent.
Now I try to push an image using a Jenkins pipline.
Of course I have installed jenkins and it takes me to the default login page where I enter my admin user and password.
The tutorial shows that the jenkins url when entered on the browser FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER INSTALLATION directly takes you to the jenkins home page instead of login page and this anonymous user literally has all the admin rights from adding plug-ins to creating/running jobs to configuring security!!!

There are several strategies that you can apply, but, as an illustration, presuming you have Gitlab pipeline (Jenkins could do the same, terminology is different, etc) here are the steps: .
You need to enable SCM polling for the Jenkins job, but it does n't matter what schedule you give it (you can make it as infrequent as you like, like monthly or yearly).
First, here 's their basic example, that assumes that you have Jenkins configured with anonymous read access enabled and CSRF disabled (so it 's not a very secure example at all).
Under the Jenkins job you will find Polling Log on the left hand side or you can just use the url like so  jenkinsurl/job/jobName/buildNumber/pollingLog/pollingLog .
This requires your Jenkins job to have credentials that enable it to write to the repository.

/pre/  This requires the value of /code/ to be set in the system configuration: From  your Jenkins home, click on Manage Jenkins --> Configure System and look for the Jenkins URL under Jenkins Location .
If you do n't have admin access to Jenkins, and /code/ is not set, you could fudge this with something like  .
I have, /url/, successfully set up Katalon with Jenkins and was able to give demo of Jenkins running tests and generating graphical test reports on builds.
To do in a better way, you could try to setup a jenkins instance to do this for you.
You need to have a service account which has access to chef so that jenkins can upload these with that account.
So I did try to add the jenkins user in the daemon group but it did n't solve this issue.

I found myself wanting to do exactly what you (the, OP) were trying to do: use Cloudformation to install Jenkins on an EC2 instance and then print the initial admin password to the Cloudformation outputs.
I ended up working around trying to read the file with the password and instead used the Jenkins CLI from the UserData section to update the admin user with a password that I specified.
/pre/  In the UserData section, I used the PassWord parameter in a call to the jenkins-cli to update the admin account : .
/pre/  Using this method, when Jenkins starts up, I don’t get the “enter the initial admin password” screen but instead I get a screen where i can just log in as admin with the password used in the parameters.
I was using "user.dir" which is by default "/" directory(manage jenkins -> system information -> system properties) I added this and it worked .
This works like a charm on the jenkins master.
We are using Jenkins 2.104.
thus different users need to authenticate before Jenkins goes ahead and deploys.

You need to set your Jenkins URL.
Go to Manage Jenkins->Configure System  .
I have two instances of Jenkins and am trying to replicate the functionality of one in the other.
The system user owning the Jenkins process has a /code/ directory (/code/ in your case) and starts all process started in Jenkins as this user.
When I go to the URL, I would like to be able to enter the IP /code/ and redirect to the login page of Jenkins.
This is really easy if you use pipeline in jenkins, and of course you need to install artifactory plugin.
You need to have credentials setup first (in jenkins credentials), and then also (in pipeline) define server and everything needed.
But in order to run the above command, I need to first get the AWS credentials from the Jenkins credentials store.

Best way to set them is in jenkins configuration.
By default security policies Jenkins user is not assigned shell access.
How to circumvent depends on operating system used on Jenkins box, but some ideas: .
Add jenkins user to docker group: In /url/ for docker for linux it is said that you need to manually place any user you want to use docker to docker group.
Grant jenkins user sudo privilege: least preferred for obvious security issues but listed here just as a quick/unsecure fix.
The workaround that I have used is define the comma separated list of individual users as a Jenkins global variable and manage the list from there.
I 've checked the box for Jenkins to add the /code/ flag to all build cycle commands .
I want these to be managed on Jenkins side.
What is considered a good practice when using credential bindings in Jenkins pipeline?

Create a username / password that Jenkins will use for Tomcat, then click /code/ .
Scroll down to the /code/ tag and underneath it add your user/pass credentials you just created in Jenkins /code/ then save and exit.
/pre/  I tried this command inside Jenkins user only .
On a different note, I always use /url/ as a Jenkins agent, for my build involving docker, precisely because I do not want to share the main host /code/ .
To make things better and easier for non-devs to be able to run individual test environments, we put the ansible script behind Jenkins and use their username to let ansible create a domain name in Route53 that points to their temporary spot instance environment.
However, I was able to use configuration file(s) managed by Jenkins.
Using Jenkins plugin 'Role-Based Strategy', I need to have user having access ONLY to a project pipeline only.

/pre/  The credentialsId /code/ is a secret text on Jenkins that has my API key.
/pre/  The first time I ran this pipeline it was not able to start docker, but I just added the user /code/ (jenkins is running with this user) to the docker group.
If you have exposed /code/ to your Jenkins, then you could use /url/, which has the same concept.
The whole point of using jenkins is to automate things so that you "manual" intervention is not required.

I wanted the right column to be aligned to right border, just as the first value under Jenkins.
Multiple CI tools in dev teams (orgs that are using also Jenkins or TeamCity or else) and need to standardize and control deployments .
/pre/  this means that your ubuntu user can ssh from jenkins server - not your jenkins user.
In order for your jenkins user to be able to ssh you either need to configure username/password for it (shell is disabled by default for jenkins user, you can enable it manually) and place credentials in it 's .ssh folder, or use Credentials plugin as suggested.
/pre/  You can try with this, it will work using jenkins .

In combination, these two features allow users with the permission to configure a job to read arbitrary files on the Jenkins master by creating an SSH credential referencing an arbitrary file on the Jenkins master, and binding it to an environment variable in a job.
You may use Jenkins tool to create a job of running your webpage test.
Then, if you want to invoke the test from the webpage, create a server side code which makes an http request using remote access API for jenkins: .
I ran into the same problem, so sharing my solution here: The user jenkins does not have access to the folder home/ec2-user/jenkins.
You can modify the access rights of the folder home/ec2-user/home by changing or adding the user jenkins to owner .
You might try using this Jenkins plugin to allow requests from your website /url/ .
I use the DynamicReferenceParameter for some advanced parameter inputs in Jenkins.
The most secure way is to make jenkins ssh session to new machine and run the command on that logged session (or use a slave to do the job).
Jenkins Pipeline provides /url/ step that can be used to write a file inside job 's workspace.

same procedure follow for other views so that you can easily move jenkins job from one view to another view.
I wanted to move my existing Jenkins job from one jenkins view to another view.
Create a custom goal which will trigger the Jenkins with an /url/.
When you use Jenkins shared library you can create a configuration class and you can expose a DSL script that allows you modifying your configuration object.
You have to add credentials in Jenkins.
Select Jenkins and it will display "Jenkins Credentials Provider: Jenkins" popup .
I am skipping jenkins stages by implementing below code, its working fine but if we check in BlueOcean it shows three nodes like .
I want to be able to link another Jenkins instance as an agent to the original Jenkins instance.
I want to push customized status details from tasks in ansible to jenkins.
I think you can change the jenkins service to also interact with the desktop.
To add, the /code/ literal is a special key used by the Jenkins Pipeline.
Using this plugin add new remote server under Publish over SSH section in Manage Jenkins >> Configure System option.
Step 2 : Implement a simple devops flow by configuring a webhook in your git provider, which automatically triggers the jenkins job (create in step 1) when you perform a git push.
Send some links in your mail using jenkins is simple .
If your requirement is send a link to allow user to open another jenkins page, you could write the following : .
This job will execute your python scripts when user clicks on email links sent by jenkins.
If you can access to your remote ec2 from another machine using your simple ssh key, Jenkins could reuse it and execute any command that is allowed to related ec2 use key.
Also you can configure a simple devops flow to avoid manually steps using webhooks and jenkins.
The Jenkins job is running as the Jenkins Admin user so I 'm not sure what else I can do?
It would be fairly easy to implement a new /code/ that would accept a list of directories to watch and would use the Jenkins plugins framework facility to take a node down if the space goes below a defined limit.
What is the recommended option to do it in Jenkins ?
Having a first play with Jenkins and trying to get an active choices parameter working using a groovy script but not having much luck.
Either way you may want to look at Jenkins-X.
I want to retrieve every job build details using by Rest API in Jenkins.
Right now I 'm using pytest and selenium to run tests on Jenkins.
Via Jenkins it 's a tic-box like this: .
Question: How can I set the permission in the jenkins file directly instead of using the ticbox?
Subprocesses of Java/Jenkins will need to have unlocked access to the Keychain.
The security command to unlock the keychain will need to be run as a Jenkins job, just once.
You probably want to be using a Jenkins credential file, not hardcoding things into the job.
You should probably just be using the environment variable support in kitchen-ec2 via the /code/ pipeline helper method or similar things for integrating with Jenkins managed credentials.
/pre/  We run Jenkins masters entirely through configuration using plugins.txt and a set of Groovy scripts to configure Jenkins, and do not allow any configuration to be done through the UI, so we also disable the ability to login as an admin.
By default it appears to be the URL to the build in Jenkins, but I would like to append something to that url like /code/.
In your Jenkins script use /code/ to update /code/ before /code/ .
/pre/  If you were using Gitlab-ci instead of Jenkins, it is possible to use the existing ci token: .
Within your Jenkins pipeline you may use /url/.
The config.xml file in /var/lib/Jenkins/users/admin/ acts sort of like the /etc/shadow file Linux or UNIX-like systems or the SAM file in Windows, in the sense that it stores the hash of the account 's password.
/pre/  Once you insert the new hash, reset Jenkins: .
Jenkins Git plugin says it can use regular expression.
Another solution is to export the image from your Jenkins, /code/ it on your slave .
The outer / I 've put around the regexp may not be needed in jenkins UI .
These permissions are activated through at Jenkins page: Jenkins->Administration->Configure Global Security.
I do n't use much dynamic library loading in my Jenkins pipeline, I actually use global library definition like: .
Is a way to get info of selected builds with Jenkins2 REST call but without knowledge of job names (i.e.
Anyway, on my raspberry pi i have setup the autorized keys file and the known host file with the public key on it, and i 've added the private key to jenkins via the ssh-agent plugin.
When I go on Manage Jenkins -> Node Management I can only add new "permanent" Agents and not the old "Dumb Slave" Node I used to have.
If I must make something like this I will use Jenkins API, JsonSlurper and TimeUnit.
From Manage Jenkins » Configure System » Global Pipeline Libraries, you can add it, selecting to load implicitly one reference.
Second part of the question, I have same website needs to be deployed in multiple locations, any help how can we achieve this using Jenkins ( no /code/).
Yes, we should approve that script using Manage Jenkins -> In Script Approval.
Go to Jenkins Job configuration, at the end of the page you can find a checkbox "Use Groovy Sandbox", uncheck that checkbox then it wo n't wait for script approval.
But best approach is we should approve the script using Manage Jenkins --> InScript approval.
I 'm new to jenkins, so I might be asking a stupid question, please feel free to enlighten me with potentionally other ways to make it work.

I know that you can set the the disable automatic SCM triggering under Configuration>build trigger but i cannot seem to save it as i am using jenkins project or some other version.
Is there a way to trigger a Jenkins build by simply sending a text message?
I 'm using Jenkins ver.
/pre/  The same applies to a parameter that is defined as part of the Jenkins job, underneath the /code/ checkbox once set.
/pre/  this is by using jenkins .
So I want a method/way to know which stage failed during the last Jenkins build and if needed run the current Jenkins build.
add your Jenkins public key to gitlab account .
I have a problem with the user-build-vars plugin for jenkins.
A Jenkins job (with the /url/) will clone the repo and make a working tree, and then can do any operation that you want (and have scripted), including a merge.
Under Manage Jenkins -> Configure System: fill in the section "Extended E-mail Notification" as per your "E-mail Notification" section.
Same script I want to execute from Jenkins pipeline, so where ever script takes input from user, I want to send mail to user, stop python script execution and wait for user input, once user provides input, proceed for further execution.
If anyone is using Jenkins with freshly installed Xcode, you 'll need to agree to the license using /code/ or agree through UI.
What I use with my spring boot apps is normally something like this(using Jenkins' SSH plugin): .
1- Go to Jenkins->Configuration->Publish over SSH->SSH Servers(on the bottom of the page), click 'Add'.
our jenkins  not started as a service, so i dont know how to allow to interact with elements .
I guess that you started jenkins and then tried to set the user defined variable in another shell.
P.S I 'm very new to Jenkins like 2 days of use, apologies in advance if I 'm being blunt.
Currently Jenkins master can do a "preventive monitoring" of the nodes in the "/computer/configure" page but it is only possible to monitor 2 disk spaces : .
Is it currently possible to achieve this in Jenkins ?
I 've created a little 'groovy script' from 'Jenkins' and trying to print the 'USER DEFINED VARIABLE".
I am using Jenkins /code/ with Blue Ocean /code/ and, while I can access the pipeline editor via the pencil icon for a pipeline created via the Blue Ocean interface, it seems I 'm unable to do the same if the pipeline has been created via the classic UI.
We use Jenkins pipeline for all our apps.
no external agents), then you should be able to SSH to the Jenkins master box and update curl (how to do this will depend on what OS you are running).
I am trying to get the list of admin user list and also the users and their level of permissions in Jenkins.
/pre/  The above is useful when you want to install different tools on your container or update configs which are not really Jenkins related.
keys need to generated from jenkins user.
Also you need to restart jenkins after adding "--prefix=/jenkins" with something like "sudo systemctl restart jenkins" using the restart button on the jenkins website did not work.
you can set parameterized build  at jenkins configure page like :  .
If you really need to use certain listed libraries, you/jenkins admin need to white-list the class by approving it.
But I am responsible for making sure our app gets built, and the Docker image built, in Jenkins.
On Splunk, I created an 'HTTP Event Collector' token and trying to configure on Jenkins using this token.
I 'm using the centos 7 &amp; facing issue while integrating selenium with Jenkins.
I.e., if you 're re-using your pipeline script from different Jenkins jobs and you do n't want to make people define that parameter ... .
I have a jenkins pipeline with user input.
I want to convert this in jenkins DSL to create jobs for each branch.
About the /code/, it is trying to install via SBT via apt with your jenkins user, when you need to be privileged user to use apt.
To have user-defined environment variables for your username show up in Jenkins, you would have to run Jenkins as a service using your username.
Open the services applet, select Jenkins service and right-click on Properties, go to the Log On tab, choose the 'This account' radio button and enter your username and password.
If the variable only needs to be known within Jenkins, you could define it globally within Jenkins (will apply to all jobs: go to "Manage Jenkins", "Configure System", scroll to "Global properties", check "Environement Variables" and add "BUILD_OUTPUT" with the value you want to assign to it) or within the job (will only apply to this job: add a parameter in the job configuration, which is passed to the job as an environment variable.
If you do n't want users to be able to change it when they request a build, the "Hidden Parameter Plugin" - not included in Jenkins by default but very easily added - could be used.)
I only see this option available for Freestyle type Jenkins Jobs.
Is this possible to check from Jenkins side?
Is there a way to avoid this issue in Github side or add additional code in Jenkins ?
Basically What I want to achieve is that I’m using a Sonarqube plugin in Jenkins, so I use extended email plugin to send email for job execution and in that email I want to give details like number of bugs in the repository after the build.
On Jenkins side, you can add a step: .
Global settings(Configure System section in Manage jenkins) of a jenkins plugin will disappear in GUI after when we apply and save the setting.
We want to view the settings when ever we reopen Configure System section in Manage jenkins.Can somebody please help me on this.
It turned out, the name of the pipeline /code/ has an /code/; and Jenkins is not escaping it or warning the user when using the GUI !!!!!!.
Just a opinion, Not a good idea to use Jenkins and ask the user to do something as that defeats the whole automation aspect...
I want to have a separate Jenkins container from the Nodejs container that orchestrates the app.
As the other answers mentioned, the crumb you get may differ depending on the browser you use to browse to Jenkins, be it Chrome, Curl or WGet.
Jenkins user and password.
We 're experimenting with containerizing Jenkins in production - the flexibility of being able to easily set up or move instances offsets the learning pain, and that pain is : .
We got around this by copying the keys to a folder outside Jenkins' home, chown/chmod'ing those keys to the Jenkins container user, then adding the key path to the container 's /etc/ssh/ssh_config.
You may want to set a timeout on your test, but remember: continuous integration tools (jenkins, travis etc.)
Your Jenkins Service is running with the System User, but you set the Environment Variable for your Windows User.
In fact, you can just use Jenkins to poll CodeCommit.
Any time there is a new commit detected, Jenkins will build it using the EBCLI.
For example when developing tests on my PC I want to use (local) ChromeDriver, but when running tests on grid with Jenkins, I want to use RemoteDriver.
One way to achieve what you want is perhaps to set the plugins in this directory before running jenkins.
If you use the official jenkins image, then perhaps you can use a data volume to store that and run docker to use this data volume: /code/ .
I 'm pretty 'new' to nodejs world and currently trying to automate regular build of UI application using Jenkins.
Now, considering you need to build all projects for every group and deploy them, use /url/ for Jenkins.
Now I can see sonarqube option in jenkins left side menu of job but it is not clickable.
That 's correct, pipeline jobs will normally use the user jenkins, which means that SSH access needs to be given for this account for it work in the pipeline jobs.
As stated in one of the answers, each individual configuration could be different, so check under "System Information" or similar, in "Manage Jenkins" on the web UI.
The first thing to do is to get a shell access as user jenkins in our case.
Assuming you can log in as root or preferably some other user (in which case you 'll need to prepend /code/) switch to jenkins as follows: .
P.S I ca n't use the jenkins image .
I want to do that on Jenkins, for multiple services, therefore it is necessary to bind to build-specific port (e.g.
I see a lot of Jenkins plugins that will do this kind of job through ssh but not in my case.
After creating Jenkins on Azure, set up tunnel using Putty in order to access Jenkins via /url/.
Step6: Select Install suggested plugins on the next page and then create a Jenkins admin user used to access the Jenkins dashboard.
If your jenkins user is already in that file, then modify to look like this: .
Documentation states:  GIT_AUTHOR_NAME and GIT_COMMITTER_NAME - The name entered if the "Custom user name/e-mail address" behaviour is enabled; falls back to the value entered in the Jenkins system config under "Global Config user.name Value" (if any) .
I want to run both steps in parallel like jenkins does it (creating multiple temp directories /code/ and so on) when 2 builds run in parallel (triggered by button presses for example).
/pre/  However, I now want to add a separate user (or same actual user but different name) for our Jenkins to run commands.
This is quick dirty code, it will print some of the credential types on jenkins, if you need more you can use the different classes defined here: .
I want to trigger Jenkins job on "hyp-z" and "hyp-x" build nodes.
/pre/   My question is then, given that app engine autocreates a Cloud Storage bucket at &lt;\PROJECT-ID>.appspot.com, is there a simple way to mount this, or even better, is there a simple way to modify the configuration of Dockerfile, or app.yaml, such that /var/jenkins is persistent?
My jenkins job has to grab a python script from one repo, and use it againsts the other repo via bash script, what is the best way to go about this?
The /code/ solution is nice when running /code/ locally, but it did n't work when trying to do it on Jenkins.
I 'm just getting the Jenkins Credentials Provider option which does n't work for container manager login.
I suppose that you needed that in form of a script, but if someone else just want to have a look through the Jenkins GUI, that list can be found by selecting the "Environment Variables" section in contextual left menu of every build Select project => Select build => Environment Variables .
Performance is generally quite good, however, whenever I try to open the configuration page (Manage Jenkins --> Configure system), it takes an extremely long time for the page to load (a good minute or so).
In my use of Chocolatey to provision Jenkins build nodes, I have a need to perform certain operations before and/or after a /code/ (e.g., stopping the Jenkins service, or /url/ after installation).
just press windows+R key and type services.msc, all the services running on your desktop will open just go to jenkins like in Capture1 image right click and open properties as in Capture2 image , than go to Log on tab, in that select (This account) and give your credentials by browse your name and password and confirm password , after giving your credential press okay ,now again go back to general tab and stop and start the jenkins service.
I want to loging as user 'jenkins' and use its own environment setup, i.e.
Also, I do n't have the password for 'jenkins', so all the  'su' solutions do n't work for me.
Step-1: Go to /Users//.jenkins .
I want to pass desired capabilities from jenkins to sauce lab .
In the /code/ below, I would like to show the current git commit id (hash) as a default value on an input form in Jenkins: .
There is something called Jenkins workflow which provides more power and control if your interested in it, you can look it up here /url/ .
You need to install the testing libraries as you normally would on the Jenkins executor nodes, and then you can use them as you normally use them from within your Jenkins job.
I am looking for a way to mark a slave permanently offline in jenkins through an API and i got this  .
/pre/  But inside Jenkins built image /code/ returns: .
I have a Jenkins parameterized build which get user input and store into a variable  say /code/.
With regards to JMeter and Jenkins integration there is /url/ which is capable of displaying performance trends you 're looking for across builds and also can mark builds as unstable or failed depending on metrics thresholds.
I can fully access Jenkins through the web interface via browser.
However not able to find a way to publish the build status from Jenkins to Bit bucket over SSH.

I am using editable email notification in jenkins, I want to add started by details in email content.
I am using Jenkins and espresso to run my automation tests.
It 's suitable to use Kubernetes /code/ and instruct your Jenkins deployment to use that account (with a bound Role): .
With /code/ you become user jenkins, but do n't execute his profile scripts.
In case you do n't have the password for user jenkins (or do n't want to login with password), but are allowed to call "sudo" you can also add "sudo" in front of the su (i.e.
But my advice here: it is better to use CI tool, such as Jenkins.
This is going to be used by Jenkins so I have limited control over how the git commands are called.
I would like to add an action in my jenkins project 's page.
We are moving to a Multibranch pipeline on jenkins, so my understanding is that we have one project per repository, and that we should use options to have different behavior.
Generally you would do this by connecting in over SSH and running /code/, either via Jenkins or a tool like RunDeck.
Create a Jenkins job for this and execute it using it 's Run button.
I would like to have a possibility to set/change the default checkout node (currently: master) of the Jenkins shared library.
This is because we are using Jenkins with many different teams and I would like to prevent any job executions on the master node.
Step 2 - Create credential using SSH keys in Jenkins, use the private key from the remote host .
I 'm trying to figure out if it 's possible to run Katalon tests remotely on CrossBrowserTesting from Jenkins?
Katalon seems great for quickly writing tests, but I need to be able to run tests automatically, remotely, from Jenkins, or it 's not actually that helpful to my team.
The variable is set by a different software so I don’t want to set it in the job itself I just want to reload it, I also do n't want to stop Jenkins slave and start it again.
We have a Jenkins pipeline setup using the Jenkinsfile to define what needs to be done for the different builds.

Can we add(restrict) emailids who can only send emails to trigger jenkins job using jenkins  Poll Mailbox Trigger plugin.
Try setting the environment variable GRADLE_USER_HOME in jenkins to another folder like c:/Users/someuser .
If you using pipeline in jenkins use /code/ its works fine.
I just joined a new company that dont have CI at all, so jumped on the opportunity to create a proof of concept (using Jenkins locally on my Windows box for now, until I get a dedicated server for it).
I 've used and semi-configured Jenkins in the past, using SVN, and it was so simple and fast to get it working.
If I want Jenkins to work with Gitlab (meaning, I checkin something and it triggers a build), do I absolutely need to use the SSH method, or it could work with HTTPS as well?
Try setting the environment variable GRADLE_USER_HOME in jenkins to another folder like c:/Users/someuser .
Use a dedicated Jenkins server(s) instead, create pipelines according to your requirements and delivery.
This exposes the API token to people viewing a Jenkins administrator’s screen, browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, etc.
Or to not delete it and just to set a profile in Jenkins: -P${profileName}  .
For legacy reasons I have to use TLS 1.0 with Jenkins.

I 'm converting a bunch of jobs to use the Jenkins pipeline language.
In plain/normal Jenkins we can use parameter types including:  .
A parameter using one of these types will pop up and prompt the user for input when they run the Jenkins job.
In Jenkins, we can define labels and group number of build slaves under the label.
Note - Jenkins user exists inside the docker container &amp; not on your host machine.
I want to do automatic build in Jenkins when code gets pushed into the Gitlab.
I am trying to create a simple CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins BlueOcean feature.
I doubt it will be added as a feature because Jenkins CPS needs source code to be able to perform CPS transofmrations, and /code/ uses binary dependencies.
Using Jenkins to create a freestyle project, when setting the repositories it asks to specify from Credentials, just like the following image shows.
We are using a parameterized Jenkins build job, and I would like to have default values for some parameters specific for myself, e.g.
We do have personal users in Jenkins.
Is it possible to setup/configure Jenkins/Jenkinsfile to permit only specific users/roles to interact with user input dialog boxes?
I mean you can do it using that but I think the better option is to access job/build metadata using Jenkins API.
/pre/  However when I try to access the Jenkins using this url: /url/ .
/pre/  I also know Jenkins support something called "milestones" apparently is something used to communicate between builds.
Hi I 'm new to jenkin and trying to configure jenkins to run coded UI Test.
I 'm using windows batch command line to run the coded ui in jenkins.
First we have to create a Jenkins job which will be triggered by web-hook.
I have a Jenkins installation in Docker and I need to create backups and restore them when I need.
My question is: how can I create full backups of my jenkins instance in docker in a way that I can restore it or even create a copy in another machine.
We can achieve it by using couple of Jenkins plugins.
Goal: Use a declarative Jenkins pipeline to download an artifact from Artifactory, run a test, and set a property value of the artifact in Artifactory based on the test result.
@francesco, Basically you have to use jobs, job template to create a jenkins job.
After upgrading Jenkins to 2.129 I was warned that 'There are users who are still using a legacy API token.'
The actual path was "/Users/Jenkins/..." but I used "/Users/jenkins..." because this was returned by the jenkins' pwd function.
While using Jenkins (a software development tool), I need to generate /code/ with using Jenkin Credentials instead of default system credentials.
Here is the current full list of custom variables that we have defined on our Jenkins slave: .
This typically is not an issue, of course, since these should always exist on a Windows system, but when building on a Jenkins slave, it creates its own custom build environment, and you must explicitly define these required built-in variables yourself.
Trying to create multijobs in Jenkins with DSL scripting.
I think, you should change Jenkins URL to /code/ and use port 8080, something like this:  .
Easiest way to programmatically access any attribute exposed via the JSON API is to take the JSON from one of Jenkins supported JSON APIs (in your case: /code/) .
Changed permissions to allow jenkins user to rwx and problem solved.
I am trying to create a Jenkins pipeline where I need to execute multiline shell commands.
/pre/  jenkins shows he first only.
/pre/  As noted in /url/, since Jenkins ~ 2.110 you have to use two additional system properties if you want to customize the locations of the builds and workspaces directories: /code/ and /code/.
I have created an node application and a jenkins pipeline, now I want to add this to github webhooks, so I want to create a webhook.
Our Jenkins build system has a few jobs that use CVS.
Trying to setup Jenkins running inside docker container and also being able to run containers there.

I am new to Jenkins world.I am trying to create a job in Jenkins where i need to input multiple file names separated by comma as input parameter.And, catch these file names in  Unix command inside Execute shell area to delete the same using rm -rf command(these files are available in some specific path).How can we use Jenkins to do the same?
I would like to more easily verify changes to Jenkins job definitions during code review.
That account just has to be able to access the Jenkins user /code/ folder.
The first step is generating SSH keys for the Jenkins user if they do not already exist.
/pre/   This is on Ubuntu, but on Windows, you need to check which user account is running Jenkins, and, as described above, copy the ssh key pair in the right /code/ folder.
Based on your description, you just need to integrate Jenkins with TFS and set CI/CD to trigger the build/release in Jenkins.
In Jenkins how can I set this value?
Also I am able to set up the gitlab webhook which triggers the build in jenkins without any issue.
As part of our build process we have several jobs that are invoked via the jenkins web api, using urls of the form: .
I would like to be able to wrap a  'stage' in Jenkins, so I can execute custom code at the start and end of a stage, so something like: .
Typically, When you need dynamic management of your branches in jenkins you would use Multibranch Pipeline and if you want to manage(setup/create/delete job in jenkins) each brach individually you will use a pipeline.
However I do n't have any idea how to implement it in Jenkins.
I want to run test cases in jenkins after clicking the button.How do i run testng testcases in Jenkins programatically ?
I am able to successfully create a node application and configured a jenkins  tool chain for it.

if you are using the Jenkins docker image, note that the image provided by Jenkins does not include this (make) along with other deps you may need.
I want to apply "/url/" to my project with one Jenkins Job if it"s possible.
What do I want from the Jenkins Job: .
One jenkins job that can handle Feature-, Develop-.
I did this by using "This project is parameterized" Option present in Jenkins- General Section.
/pre/  Furthermore, jenkins executes this bash call with the "jenkins" user, belonging to the "jenkins" group.
I have two set of Jenkins users  (QA &amp; Dev) and different set of nodes (servers) for each  QA &amp; Dev teams.
Jenkins job is Parameterized job, users can enter different node (IP) when Jenkins job run.
But is such a setting modification possible  on the /url/ (jenkins/jenkins lts) using the provided jenkins user with no root access ?
We are using Jenkins ver.
I am using p4 plugin for jenkins and there are a couple of independent projects that I do n't want to build on each stage to save time .
To use credentials in a pipeline, you do not need to do anything special, you access them just as you would for credentials stored in Jenkins.
This option works in principle, but I loose the automatic unique path-names per project from Jenkins.
I am trying to make a simple jenkins docker pipeline build using a jenkinsfile.
You can also save the other SSH key in the Jenkins Credentials and then use native git commands (works in scripted pipeline, I do n't know about declarative pipeline): .
I have been trying to build an Android application using Jenkins.
Modify jenkins startup parameters (/etc/default/jenkins) to use the Trust store and Keystore.
It was easier for me to have a "per-job" behavior, without touching jenkins global settings.
However, the job is being run as user /code/ (as reported by /code/), which is the default user for Jenkins.
This is actually not a Jenkins question, yet I added the Jenkins tag since other Jenkins users may face similar issues and maybe there is a built-in option I am not aware of.
Manage Jenkins >Config slicing > select options  .
When Jenkins checks out from your SCM keeping them together in the one repository will allow you to apply a tag (label) when the test suite passes.
I 've acquired one of the /url/ using: Jenkins, Docker (ACS), Kubernetes (AKS).
You can also uncheck the corresponding box in the Jenkins system settings if you are administrator for your Jenkins, see here: .
Say I need to create a new global jenkins user "jenkins" and I want my keys to be in the path "/home/jenkins/.ssh/", add "jenkins" user to the machines first.
4) You need to have ssh keys in both master and slave machines in the same path and with same "jenkins" user permissions.
Make sure you give the same remote root directory - "/home/jenkins" in your node configuration and select "manually trusted key verification strategy" - as suggested in /url/ .
/pre/  Jenkins (Windows): .
Problem is not all developers have permission to take problematic nodes offline, so they end up not being able to build their branch because Jenkins keeps trying to re-run on the same one.
How can I use these values that I get from jenkins to pass them into my gherkin step?
Regular, non-Jenkins users, can activate this conda environment just fine.
Consider that you have to set the credentials on the jenkins/credentials first.
to check the JENKINS_JOB_URL/lastBuild/consoleText .
Is this possible using Jenkins?
You should use it if you need some stuff for Jenkins pipeline.
2.You will see the plugin in the main screen of Jenkins on the left side.
7.copy the code (or part of it that you need) and add it to your Jenkins pipeline..  .
Put /code/ as user and /code/ as a password, your admin password is the one you got while installing jenkins.
I am trying to use a global Jenkins variable in the Repository URL field: .
Implementing such a polling scheme can be done by implementing a custom Jenkins plugin just for that.
We possibly would have to use Jenkins or CodePipline for it.
We have created My tab plugin which we can use from allure-commandline but same we need to use in our Jenkins CI.
Like when you need to run Docker inside the Jenkins(in Docker), it would become complicated somehow.
I tried running the Jenkins service as a different user and that also had no effect.
You can trigger Jenkins based on a push to a branch: /url/ /url/   .
Manage Jenkins -> Configure Global Security -> Markup Formatter .
What is the best way to achieve it in Jenkins?
I am trying to implement CI/CD pipeline by using Kubernetes and Jenkins.
Is this mandatory to use Jenkins master and slave ?.
I am using Jenkins pipeline for building and pushing the image to DTR.
/pre/  I want to automate the release process so in my Jenkins pipeline script, I would like to be able to run a command and update the 'common.version' to whatever the user entered as parameter.
I need to setup parametrized job in Jenkins, which will retrieve commit history, from multiple repos, starting from test* in their name in specific date range (will be set in jenkins parameters).
If your Jenkins job is configured to be triggered by SCM changes, you can trigger jobs using the REST API (using the same interface that you can use in e.g.
I 've been looking into this the last few days as well and have come to see that using a groovy based template using the jenkins Email-ext plugin is the way to go.
In this integration pipeline in Jenkins, I am triggering different builds in parallel using /url/, as follows: .
Is there anything like this available in Jenkins?
I would like to run difftool during jenkins job to allow the user to decide which line is correct during the job.
I also confirmed that both jenkins and my terminal user are same and in the same directory.
I just want to know if there is any way to make this connection (Jenkins and Kubernetes) using Jenkins file so that I will use it to deploy the application on Kubernetes.
If I disable the SSHD port in Manage Jenkins -> Configure Security, Then I can able to launch my slave.
When you have automation like Jenkins running jobs, it 's best to create a service account for Jenkins, /url/.
Once you create the Jenkins service account, you can extract an authentication token for that account, which you put into Jenkins.
I do n't want to create simulations for each case, as this would be a nightmare to manage (and getting rid of manually managed data and jenkins jobs with jmeter is what we are trying to achieve).
In previous versions of Jenkins, I have seen that we have "Password Parameter" to add in a job where when a user pass a value to that while running the job, it wont display the chars and instead they 'll be masked.
The Jenkins master supports many kinds of workers (slaves) via plugins - you can have stand alone nodes, Docker based slaves, Kubernetes scheduled Docker slaves, etc.
Just use Helm to launch the Jenkins master, then connect to the Jenkins master and configure it to use Kubernetes slaves.
Our team have a Tv show a specific view of Jenkins, when a job have problem they  will come this View.
I would like to monitor multiple Jenkins servers health checks in a single Jenkins server as dashboard.Can some one let me know what all the options do we have for this ??
I am using the /code/ for jenkins... and not sure how to get the host url for hubot, like where it runs .
You can enable the remoting option by writing a bit of Groovy that gets run when Jenkins starts, but a better option is to configure the proper authentication and use the ssh or http methods.
I want Jenkins to manage my hooks.
I 'm used to triggering build by comment with Jenkins using this plug-in: /url/ .
I would like to add a possibility to extends the global parameters define in a Jenkins pipeline.
in Jenkins server created ssh key for the user jenkins and added that into this repository deploy keys.
As for me, if you use Jenkins, make your deploy in daclarative way - use /code/.
 Go to Your Jenkins UI, click on the peoples section on left side.
Requirement: We need to create a GitHub hook in such a way that, if anyone merges the branch (create pull request and merge it), then it should trigger the Jenkins job.We do not use multibranch pipeline, we use just pipeline jobs i.e we use jenkisnfile to run our jobs.
I believe you did the breakup of your 75 project in group based on certain thought process hence my suggestion is to have have group-wise Jenkins jobs it will give better control also.
I would check the user who is running the jenkins process and make sure they are part of the docker group.
/pre/  I am currently trying to migrate to jenkins declarative syntax, but i do n't see a simple way to create a parameter that is only available in some conditions (i know i can ignore it, but i do n't really want it to show it at all).
For every build Jenkins give it a number for ex.
So, is there a way this can be done via Jenkins or via GIT to revert the changes to last stable one.
/pre/  We use this script in a PowerShell task in Jenkins to add users to databases.
I am looking for an API to delete Jenkins global credentials or some other way to delete the global credentials through CLI but cant seem to find any luck.
Option #1 Go to you Jenkins job and search for "add build step" and then just copy and paste your script there .
I 'm new in rancher/docker world, and i am  trying to find the best way to execute commands from Jenkins in an existing container (mainly bash and php commands), in order to use Jenkins as a job scheduler.
Is there a setting in Jenkins that will allow me to replace the spaces in the name with another character like an underscore "_".
/pre/  In the Jenkinsfile you can use /code/ to get the Jenkins URL.
We use Jenkins on top of K8s to manage our build.
Jenkins is only involved in the builds triggered from the 'Pipeline' menu option.
run /code/ in pipeline script and see paths available to Jenkins user.
I am trying to figure a way to add my Jenkins job parameters displayed in job configure page into slave node (windows PC).
I need something like this /url/ for Jenkins pipeline .
Any idea why this is different under Jenkins?
Then go to the plugin displayed on left side of jenkins.
Which steps are required for the Jenkins mailer plug-in to use an Outlook.com (aka Hotmail) account?
Is it possible to provision multiple vms from an agent template/snapshot and access them within a Jenkins job?
Which Jenkins job would be best suited for this kind of workflow?
I have not been able to get spark-submit to work with Jenkins natively.
If it not visible inside a Jenkins job.
I do n't have access to both servers so cli is not an option only jenkins ui is available.
I needed to login as the jenkins user and try to ssh to my raspberry pi (which are both on the same machine).
Then I switched user to the jenkins user.
I am able to successfully connect and push my container if I "build with parameters" in the Jenkins UI and just paste in my key.
I am using jenkins blueocean plugin to create Pipeline view of my jenkins job.
I 'd like to use SSH keys located in system file (from the Jenkins master /code/ option).
Is anyone using a different solution to reference a script with dependencies from within Jenkins?
I 've setup some global credentials in jenkins, username password type.
The Security related pages in Jenkins are not currently part of the REST API.
You can stop Jenkins jobs using cURL and the /url/.
I could delete the repo and re-create it with the same name, but then all my settings are lost (like Jenkins hooks).
Can you check  the bind IP address of Jenkins, if you want to access your Jenkins from outside it should be /code/ or /code/ .
JenkinsBot) in your confluence instance and use that bot 's credentials in your script for Jenkins to create a new page inside a specified space or update an existing page.
Even though the jenkins documentation says I should use "${ITEM_FULL_NAME}", I 've tried different variants (ITEM_FULLNAME) etc.
Installing nodejs on top of the jenkins image is the way to go.
Note: I am trying to pass this URL (with PAT) to Jenkins 'Team Foundation Server Plugin' and does not want specifying the username password either manually or in Global configuration.
However, I could n't find it in the list of a Jenkins but another one has it.
Also, How can i add a particular plugin in my Jenkins server?
Which way did you search the plugin (jenkins gui, in the web)?
Also, How can i add a particular plugin in my Jenkins server?
I am trying to use /url/ with Jenkins.
I need to run the following command within Jenkins: .
If you have the jenkins instance already running, go to $JENKINS_BASE_URL/configure and check the value of 'Home directory' - that is the place where all user-specific data is stored, like the jobs.
Then go to /url/ --> manage Jenkins --> github settings --> add user --> Select secret text--> paste the token .
Another example is that I want to patch my app in Jenkins Pipeline.
I want to remotely build a jenkins job using multiple parameter through restassured API jobs in java.
The best one - Manually created a Jenkins file that described the best I could of the AHP process 2.
I am able to see the summary of test cases generated at jenkins ui at /code/.
To integrate this scheme in Jenkins, I will need separate job for this.
So I have generated public and private keys, public was added in GitLab (Settings > SSH Keys) and private key file content was inserted into text area in Jenkins Project settings (Source Code Management > Credentials > SSH Username with private key > Private key)  .
I 'm now trying to set up another machine as slave for this Jenkins master and I think I need to manually copy the public SSH keys of the master to the new slave machine.
Jenkins jobs is using the variable /code/ which can be used as input for users.
If you are using traditional Jenkins jobs, then you can pass password also like any other variable.
/pre/  to force Jenkins to switch to my individual account on localhost and then use private keys to connect to target box (no password).
Use Jenkins to automate the process .
Everytime a non-admin user in Jenkins makes some changes in Jenkins, the script changes has to be approved by a Jenkins admin.
i have installed and enabled this plugin as mentioned in the page, and the plugin status shows enabled as well here /code/and also jenkins process /code/ shows the plugin status but my script changes(as non-admin user) still asks for admin approval.
Use username of that specific user (instead of the /code/ username) when creating the SSH credentials in Jenkins.
Besides that obvious Yes button there are some hidden form fields where one of those is named Jenkins-Crumb.
While the Jenkins-Crumb form field is populated via JavaScript, there 's no need to execute the JavaScript as the script is directly included as /code/ into the HTML source where it can be /url/.
I am trying to learn how to use Jenkins.
One of my users (jenkins) should be added to cluster role system:controller:persistent-volume-binder.
Now I want to add "jenkins" to ClusterRole system:controller:persistent-volume-binder.
for your OData project, when your way to scan the code is via jenkins, you have to set in the settings of jenkins with the hostname, don´t recommend put "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" .
Go to Settings in Jenkins .
I 'm trying configure my Jenkins to allow remote job trigger using REST API.
/pre/  How to configure Jenkins to allow url basic auth?
I am using /url/ 3.5.5 with Jenkins 2.89.2. .
I want to re-use data stored in /code/ H2 database to graph dependencies between jobs, not only rely on deatures available in Jenkins GUI.
I am passing multiple parameters to a grade task from jenkins and want to pass username and password as well.
I am attempting to our company 's Jenkins from the Jenkins user database + matrix based security to using Google Login Plugin and Role based strategy plugin to give us better control of our user accounts.
With this new set up I am wondering how I could go about creating a designated user which is used by scripts which trigger Jenkins jobs remotely.
Before the switch to Google Login I could just create a user manually in the Jenkins user database and take the API token from there but since switching to Google Login there is no option to add a user (which makes sense given than the users are managed by Google now).
Use Google Login Plugin and create a new dedicated "Jenkins" user in GSuite for these scripting / requirements.
It uses a magic semi-internal Google provided Jenkins setup called Kokoro which provides low visibility on configuration.
I am trying to setup a Jenkins job for Xamarin.Forms app.
Even if you figure out how to do it in command line, and in InteliJ, then think about moving to some kind of Continuous Integration framework, like Jenkins for example, which will use default /code/?
I am using Jenkins and its ClearCase UCM plugin, but am unable to make it work (make ClearCase checkout the proper view in the Jenkins job workspace).
This is one another way to get Jenkins metrics into Splunk (indexes provided by this Jenkins Add-on/App), you should check that too as it provides out of the box dashboards etc.
Splunk Plugin (in Jenkins) works together with a Splunk App for Jenkins that provides out-of-the-box dashboards and search capabilities to enable organizations to run a high performing Jenkins cluster and bring operational intelligence into the software development life cycle.
So you need to install Jenkins Slave agent software on the machine where JMeter lives and once done you will be able to run JMeter either via /url/ or via /url/.
From the comments, the default value for those field is fine, and Jenkins will create a dynamic view accessing the UCM components if the stream mentioned in the settings of that plugin.
I cannot seem to make my image run from Jenkins.
I am trying very hard to get Jenkins to work here -- But am I wasting time trying, if the cert.
I am able to capture the Git change log in Jenkins using the Git Changelog plugin.
I am trying to use Kubernetes and Jenkins tools for implementing this.
Alternatively, you may use a build tool like jenkins to trigger a custom job through job link and passing username and password as parameters in the link to trigger job.
My goal is to create an automation where users can deploy a full environment via ARM templates using jenkins in their MSDN subscription.
My automation requires creating a SP that will be used from a linux machine using jenkins that needs to read resource group machines properties.
Push Docker Images  (make sure you called docker login on Jenkins) .
In the "Kubeconfig" dropdown, select the > /url/ stored in Jenkins.
I 'm looking for the same ability but via Jenkins Pipeline (since a job configured as a pipeline does n't have the checkbox mentioned above).
In TFS/VSTS, add a new Service Hook, and select Jenkins and choose Code checked in or Code pushed event (it depends on which version control type you use in TFS).
Add node:   Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes > New Node.
However, the Jenkins server on which the IE is running is not available for login so I cannot login and set the mode.
/pre/  I am trying to configure a jenkins job (using jenkins pipeline) to do a git pull on a remote server using sshagent I need to use the GIT_CREDS defined in the pipeline for git pull on remote server Need something like: .
However we are struggling to identify a good way to build these multiple packages with Jenkins.
the infra guys said we could try doing the same task using jenkins, so security breach would n't be a problem they say.
Hooks to trigger Jenkins from SVN are also possible.
I am  using Declarative Pipeline in Jenkins and i have more than 200 tests.
However, I 'm using /url/ with GSuite instead of Google Login Plugin, but from Jenkins security perspective I assume they work in the same way.
As I 'm trying to automate the process with Jenkins I would like to check if a file exists before uploading it.
Consider using the /url/ - it allows to back up all your Jenkins settings (including job configurations) to git or SVN.
I am trying to implement Jenkins for automating the deployment of a node application.
You can setup it up with local cmd file or create a script with CI servers like TeamCity or Jenkins triggered by a button click or on code change.
As a Developer,I need to send the notification to the user 's Slack Channel (That channel has Jenkins CI app)  from Jenkins dynamically.
So I have to get the below things of Jenkins CI app(Already installed in user 's channel)by using Slack OAuth.
/pre/  Depending on how you actually start your jenkins etc.
Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Scroll down to E-mail Notification tab -> Advanced .
I have a image based on /url/ that is setup to launch based on a Jenkins job.
I want to pass startTLS option for jenkins /url/-    .
Is it possible to restore Jenkins if needed with just those two things?
Question: can I somehow, through ssh'ing into another machine, use Jenkins ssh-agent credentials to clone/update a bitbucket repository?
We made our Jenkins Views fast again by reducing the default builds stored per job and delete the old builds as suggested by khampson.
I 'm trying to add some functionality to a Jenkins plugin that 's written in Jelly + Java.
I tried to use DIAWI api with jenkins it all works fine but I am not able to send diawi link in the email.
/pre/  It is quite possible that your Jenkins box is not able to establish a connection to the database and the ports are fire-walled off etc.
Thanks to @csanchez I figured out that I was needed to get credentials under jenkins user.
First some background to understand the reasoning (this is pure ssh, no Jenkins or Mercurial specific): the /code/ utility works by making a UNIX domain socket to be then used by /code/.
If you want one jenkins to talk to kubernetes API with different service accounts you need to create multiple Jenkins "clouds" in configuration, each with different credentials.
there’s currently no other way with Jenkins to get an API token until we move to ephemeral / one shot masters rather than static masters.
What 's the right way to grant Jenkins permissions to access this file and other files it needs to use?
I deploy an angular application by Jenkins and I want to display the build number in the footer of the page.
Create another step in jenkins to update /code/ in /code/ with Build No.
If that succeed, validate you docker socket can be used by the Jenkins user.
Go to Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> Available tab -> Filter by 'Pipeline AWS'.
Jenkins > Credentials > System > Global credentials (unrestricted) -> Add .
But there is no quickstarts templates for this kind of scenario, what is the best way to implement this with Jenkins-X?
Also we use bitbucket server (was able to integrate this into jenkins-x), how should the trigger be configured.
One thing to note is that when i run the container specifically on the docker node and then try to ssh using the same credentials that i am using in jenkins i can ssh into the container.
I 'd like to also store the UUID with the Jenkins job so we can query Jenkins for the UUID.
/pre/  Regardless, I think there should be a way to tell a Jenkins pipeline that it should run with specific settings, like sh=bash.
I am trying to create a task with the Jenkins API.
/pre/  Are there any alternative/simple way to add timestamp in artifacts in Jenkins?
So here my requirement is that I need to build multiple docker images for different tenant with different configuration added in Dockerfile from one code repo by using Jenkins .
Can I add multiple pipeline job from same code repository using Jenkins?
So I want a build on Jenkins to be triggered when a pull request is approved by the named reviewer.
I am integrating Jmeter test cases with Jenkins and using performance plugin able to see trend graph.
/pre/  Could there be a similar option when using Jenkins?
So, your changes in your repository will trigger one Jenkins build and produce one docker image.
It will break when you start with 2.x but you can either add a second branch in the Jenkins UI with the pattern /code/ (no colon here!)
/pre/  For some reason, Jenkins does n't use /code/ value.
I need create apk files with dynamic IPs from parameters selected on Jenkins./url/ .
Jenkins provides: .
Seems that I had to change Jenkins user - this question 's anwers are helpful: .
If we use jenkins, how can we get a better option for the replacement for web2y?
I am going to use Jenkins for CI and need a way to secure these keys.
One way to do that is by using the Jenkins Global Tool Configuration.
Standard practice here is to do a build in Jenkins or whatever you are using.
I want to connect to a Jenkins slave via SSH.
At the moment I add the name manually in the Jenkinsfile but I think it would be better if I can just retrieve this information from Jenkins.
I suggest using Jenkins and send mail via the /url/.
I am using vars_prompt in ansible playbook to pass some user-defined parameters, when i run the ansible playbook manually, it asks for prompts and runs successfully but when i build using jenkins it does n't prompt for any inputs.
/pre/  How can I make jenkins to ask for prompts that can be passed to the ansible playbook?
If your Jenkins uses a /code/ set of tags, put the new plain text password in there and Jenkins will read it.
Once Jenkins starts up, go to the Configure System > Configure Global Security page and click Save.
Jenkins has a 'Replay' feature, which enables you to quickly replay a job without updating sources: .
I have set up a way for my team to click on some links to trigger some jenkins jobs.
Now, I want to know how to use docker-compose to basically pull the image, run and expose ports through Jenkins in multiple servers?
Our Jenkins runs under user /code/, so testing that value is also a possibility.
2) Please change the user-mode of Jenkins and docker same by running below command and restart both Jenkins and docker and now u will be able to access.
Also I build just one server using jenkins, its working fine.
Update: After adding the Scan for compiler warnings Post Build action in Jenkins, there will be an Advanced button.
When use /code/, means the credential had been added into Jenkins, /code/ can extract the user and password value into Shell variables, then you can use them by refer the shell variables.
This why you see the password show in plain text in jenkins console  .
How do I create a custom test that creates a report that Jenkins, or a common plugin, understands.
I am happy to make it create a report in a format that imitates one of the standard ones if that then allows me to collate the test results within Jenkins using an available plugin.
I 've got a Jenkins box set up on RHEL7, mainly via the (admittedly rotting) Chef cookbook, so it 's repeatable and nearly idiot-proof.
Is there some Jenkins-foo I can use?
I use Sonarqube with Jenkins to check various violations.
I am trying access one of the Jenkins job 's log using groovy script.
Now, I want to trigger same test via jenkins job which should actually do the same activity as above.
If there is the way to trigger Jenkins build via push to a specific branch on GitLab.
Possibly there is a login page of Jenkins, you should include it to access your next page.
In my Jenkins scripted pipeline I 'm trying to copy files to a remote Windows Share using /url/ .
I would like to ask on how can I add another step for pulling another repo on the jenkins pipeline I created.
In Jenkins you can choose which shell you want to use to execute shell scripts, but it only lets you choose one.
My build is done using Jenkins.
Is there a way to use curl to create a Jenkins job using Jenkinsfile inside Gitlab?
I went to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins and was able to update all of the plugins that were in need of it.
Is it possible to hide this in console output of Jenkins.
following console output is from Jenkins for checkout scm step, which I want to hide .
I have set up a new Jenkins Server and copied the Jobs and plugins from the old Jenkins Server, but stragely there are 2 Options missing while entering a private key for the global User/Account.
I am using scrippted pipeline in Jenkins and I want to compile a solution using MsBuild.
I am trying to create a Jenkins job that has dependent parameters.
For now, I managed to find a workaround (which works as I want it to), but I had to explicitly approve usage of some methods, which are marked by Jenkins as vurnelabilities.
I want to list all the jobs that are timely triggered in my jenkins.
We use codeception for testing, and I wanted to add that to the pipeline, and have the codecoverage for each build display in Jenkins.
You can do this by going to Manage Jenkins -> Configure Global Security -> Agents -> Agent Protocols... /url/ .
Add the password to /etc/default/jenkins with .
/pre/  The password is processes by /etc/init.d/jenkins and added to DAEMON_ARGS in the following way: .
/pre/  This makes SPECIAL_PASSWORD available to jenkins when it starts.
The password is visible in the SystemInfo tab in jenkins as an ENV variable and could be used by jenkins build jobs.
Storing the password in the /etc/default/jenkins is not desired.
That 's why I 've implemented the following scripts that  1. ask for a password 2. adds the SPECIAL_PASSWORD to /etc/default/jenkins 3. restarts jenkins 4. restores the /etc/default/jenkins to the original version without the password .
The password for a brief moment of time is available in /etc/default/jenkins.
I am able to create a "Pipeline" item in Jenkins where I am specifing a Jenkinsfile to use a docker container to run all the stages like this: .
The working directory of our Jenkins is under "/User/shared", and our SDK is under "/User/foo" .
By the way, in general, on Jenkins, if you want to totally solve this issue regarding special characters, you may take at look at /url/.
You 'll want to take advantage of the /url/ of Jenkins, and then only consume those credentials in the /code/.
You may also have good success making use of the /url/ in Jenkins, to create a new "step" to do the credential binding and interaction with /url/ and /url/.
But going by your Jenkins settings screenshot, you 're using the very-long-deprecated /code/ property to restrict analysis to C# files, and then not performing a "proper" C# analysis.
I am trying to use a groovy variable in my Jenkins file as shown below .

But I want jenkins automatically push the result to me.
I want to achieve this using jenkins plugins, but I find no plugin that meet my requirement.

I use AWS Lambda to trigger Jenkins when I push something to CodeCommit.
You know you can manually trigger Jenkins using cURL: .
I want run automatically my Protractor tests in Jenkins job.
Now with the Jenkins Image that I am using, it loads all configs under /code/ .
/pre/  Looks like Jenkins loads the default /code/ file and then overwrites it with the one I send which makes Jenkins freak out.
This will enable our Jenkins to run different tests without the need to duplicate test cases again and again.
You are basically mounting /code/ on top of /code/ and jenkins cannot write to it.
It defaults to one of the credentials that I defined to Jenkins via the Credentials Plugin.
I have to define a single select combo box where a list of available values is defined in a Jenkins environment variable (/code/).
I 've been trying to use my customized content for the Jenkins build emails.

Jenkins naturally shows changes on a job.
Firstly for Grab to work your Jenkins needs to have access to the internet.
Would that be possible changing the root of the Jenkins or any other ways?

I want run automatically my Protractor tests in Jenkins job.
I 'm trying to do a pretty simple thing I believe - trigger a Jenkins job from a slash command in slack.
I want to type /code/ in slack and that should trigger particular jenkins job.
In this case I created new user in Jenkins and got API token.
I can not rely on first building /code/ as I can not be sure for Jenkins to run both jobs on the same host using same local repository (I do n't want to change that).
I have implemented a sample CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins for an application.
We are using Jenkins for CI, we want to run Karma execute command only once.
I have 1 pipeline job in Jenkins that was used as a template to create 7 more jobs using the "Copy From" option.
In order to make the first case work (Using the GET request), I had to enable the "Allow anonymous read access" in Jenkins, in Manage Jenkins -> Configure Global Security as per the screenshot below.
The following steps apply to adding credentials in Jenkins.

Jenkins requires an agent field to be present which i set to 'any'.
I have created a TestNG project in Jenkins and trying to schedule that job to run and send the result to email.
Is it possible to add a Short note while aborting a build manually in Jenkins?
it is possible in Teamcity but i dont see any option in Jenkins.
But obviously I do n't want to put the full path with my user in it as it needs to work on a Jenkins server and other user machines.
Create Jenkins pipelines to enforce this criteria.
/pre/  If anyone knows why Jenkins behaves that way, please explain.
Is this also possible using the Jenkins plugin?
Or you might need to define those Jobs depending on each other (There is an option to build if a SNAPSHOT has been updated in Jenkins).
Like Darksaint2014 said, you need to configure two parts if you installed Jenkins in Windows.
I want to send some specific notifications (REST API) back to our server, which triggered our Jenkins build jobs via REST API.
Do I need to write a Jenkins Plugin for this (hope not).
Then you can use the post handling built into the Jenkins pipeline language.
Manage Jenkins > Manage Users > Create User > Provide User Name, Password, Email &amp; all required details  .
I am trying to integrate CI/CD using Jenkins.
I even tried unloading the Jenkins using this command: .
I have been trying to get code coverage in sonar using Jenkins.
If use jenkins official docker image: /code/, want to connect github, is it necessary to generate a ssh key under Jenkins user in the container?
There is a way to use this global tool without passing the InstallShield license to the Jenkins slave machine?
You need to add a flag which allows starting Jenkins with unsupported Java versions.
I think the problem is that whichever user ID Jenkins is using to run the job needs to be added to your github repo as a collaborator.
I am able to download code from clear case using Jenkins.
I 'm afraid the Jenkins plugin does n't use partial workspaces but regular ones.
If you enable the "Use update" setting, Jenkins will not delete the workspace at the end of each build and the full update will only be performed the first time.
I found this to create credentials in Jenkins using a REST API call, how to update the credentials with a given id using the REST API calls?
I tried to use jenkins cli but having authorization issues (i am not an admin and have no user and password).
Do we need to use SSH or provide the path of git(windows) in jenkins server.
I was trying to set up a jenkins docker container in the ECS fargate.
The key difference I think is that Jenkins-X is driven towards a highly automated CI/CD flow with particular environments in the flows.
In jenkins tried after adding below but no use.
For example, would n't it be terrible if a pipeline could call /code/ and shut down Jenkins for all of the users?
I have integrated this with Jenkins and a properties file in GIT that has list of users.
For security reasons we thought it would be better if the Jenkins windows service would run as user without admin rights.
/pre/  The user (Windows 7, Active Directory user) has all rights on the Jenkins folder (excluding 'Special rights', which cannot be chosen).
Is it possible/reasonable to run the Jenkins windows service (server as well as slaves on other computers) as non-admin user?
In Jenkins pipelines, if you want to use the /code/ step in a case insensitive way you 'd call it like this (as described /url/): .
Alternatively, /url/ offers 50 minutes of free Jenkins builds each month to all free users and more time to paid users.
I use Jenkins to run the custom BDD framework.
This looks like jenkins user is not authorized to launch chrome.
It works gallantly however, we all need to sign our binaries do n't we and I 've found no way to upload a key as I would to a Jenkins server for doing this.
I have three slave node on which I want to run the jenkins jobs and I want to integrate them in a single Pipeline as a code for achieving automation .
However, it can display any image in the report when I view it in Jenkins Server like the picture: .
Follow these steps: If not already done, generate a rsa key in your Jenkins server for the user that you are using to access bitbucket.
Combined the label with a task of Jenkins by "Restrict where this project can be run" .
Set an authentication token which will be asked for once you select the Remotely Trigger option under Build Trigger in you Jenkins dashboard.
Jenkins job has been created in order to listen for all reposiotory branches changes and is authenticated via ssh.
I use /url/ on Jenkins side.
In New Jenkins, Click Rename link present in the left navigation pane, Update the job name and click save.
Generally you can determine which libraries ca n't be found by using the /url/ command as your Jenkins user, for example: .
This does have the advantage of only affecting your Jenkins user and not requiring additional privileges to set up.
Use Jenkins to use POST to webhook as created by automation runbook.
For Now, I can only create a dataproc cluster by my own account " gcloud auth login" But I want create dataproc cluster from jenkins by setup .
Is there any easy way to SSH twice from Jenkins?
I want to use Jenkins to run automated hardware tests controlled by various Python scripts.
A simple solution is to use /url/ in Jenkins.
I ended up ditching the Xcode-Plugin for Jenkins and made direct calls to /code/ and /code/ based on the instructions detailed in /url/ and a /url/.
You can use 'Filesystem List Parameter' Plug-in in Jenkins, which can be useful for your question.
In the same way also help me in how to configure profiles in Jenkins.
Both seems to maintain Jenkins images in hub.
But I cannot find a way to retrieve resulting diagrams on the Jenkins web interface, even when using the pipeline script generator.
I am using a virtual machine to run a set of tests on Jenkins (written in C#) that are sending Http Web Requests to register, login etc etc.
go to Jenkins job > Configure > tick Build periodically in build Triggers and put cronjob syntax like below image and Save.
First some background : I have a remote jenkins that performs some Newman tests on my web app built with PlayFramework.
/pre/  As a second step, I would like to make it work on my remote Jenkins.
I m trying to generate performance report through jenkins peformance plug-in, when ever i try to perform build now.
I 'm using Jenkins 2.121.3 which has removed the functionality to use a key from the ~/.ssh/ directory on the Jenkins master.
I have generated a private/public key pair and added the contents of the key to the Jenkins credential.
If your Jenkins setup has enough parameters for image names and version tags, then you should be able to run the x86 and Power setups side-by-side; you need to encode the architecture somewhere in the built image name or tag; for instance, /code/.
I want run automatically my Protractor tests in Jenkins job.
3) In the Jenkins project settings selected the option /code/ and selected the host i 've added in step 2. .
Is there a way to make workspace editable in jenkins.
It is interesting that we must have used Jenkins predefined build environment variables like /code/, /code/ etc in a lot of our Jenkins job.
Is there an easy way to restrict the number of allowed concurrent builds per user in Jenkins?
Ideally I 'm looking for a solution that would work with the new jenkins pipeline interface as well.
I am trying to determine if a git branch exists in a specific location using batch through Jenkins.
There is no option for managing multiple Jenkins servers health checks in a single Jenkins Server specially on Open source Jenkins.
CloudBees Jenkins Analytics also make the monitoring of multiple masters easier by adding a number of new graphs.
I have tried several solutions (using an NFS) .... but it does n't work ... Jenkins do n't want to display the workspace  (even if the workspace is at the right NFS location, and on the master).
Currently I set my Gitlab that whenever I push to a branch it will trigger a build in Jenkins using webhook.
Go to: Manage Jenkins > Configure System .
You can select the events for which you want the Jenkins build to be triggered.
We will select ‘Just the push event’ because we want to run the build when we push our code to the repository Alternatively, you can click on ‘Let me select individual events’ to get a list of all the events that you can select to trigger your Jenkins build.
Adding angular build script in jenkins:  In the main page of Jenkins select New Item.
Right now I am trying to automatically deploy the app I built to a docker container that 's a sibling to the Jenkins container.
Is there a alternate way to delete the file in Jenkins with-out using OS command?
I have setup a Jenkins pipeline job, for which I only want to only kickoff the job when changes are made to a certain directory.
Second, you 'll need to modify the S3 profile in the Jenkins "Configure System" form.
If you want to persist something from the workspace in this environment, the best way would be to create a build artifact so that Jenkins archives it.
Set up Security at Manage Jenkins > Configure Security .
Is it possible to use Jenkins to build NativeScript?
If you run Jenkins within Docker, one possible solution would be via SSH: .
Can i set the feed URL inside the CSPROJ without specific Jenkins command ?
I would suggest installing Jenkins in a secondary partition, like /code/.
With that in place I always set the Jenkins service to run as a user (preferable a service account with a non-expiring password) that is a member of the Administrators group on the box.
I am trying to run jenkins container.
In the end I managed to achieve what I wanted to do via the Jenkins lock resource plugin.
We are implementing a GitOps like CI/CD in Jenkins.
Short Summary: The "Create User" form in Jenkins does nothing.
MY QUESTION: How would I fix this issue in Jenkins on Mac OS X High Sierra so that I can create, both, new administrative and general users?
I want to fire some LDAP commands which I usually fire from the terminal but instead of the terminal, I want to do it from jenkins so that I do n't have to type in those commands everytime.
/pre/  Your sudoers file could look something like this (assuming your Jenkins user is /code/): .
The sudoers file is /url/ and you should be able to restrict jenkins while still allowing it to do the job it needs to do.
SSH into Jenkins and go to the workspace jenkins is using as the jenkins user.
Actually jenkins has quite a flexible choice of methods for jobs that need to interact with one another.
Jobs in remote jenkins or external to jenkins can be used to trigger jobs using this method.
I am trying to use Jenkins scripted pipeline for our project.
Secondly, if you have n slaves with the same label (let 's say BUILD) you just need to configure your job with this label so that it will run on any of the slave (jenkins will choose the less loaded) having this label, and the checkout will be made on that slave.
I have managed to make it work if I configure it with the GUI directly inside Jenkins but I would like to avoid that if possible.
As the cloud-hosted kubernetes I use is going from dockerd to containerd as container runtime, I want to ask if there is somebody who is using containerd with jenkins kubernetes plugin (especially podtemplates).
Issue comes in when I configure jenkins to use ldap to authenticate users.
Lookup User lookup: successful User ID: test User Dn:   "cn=test+gidNumber=5556+givenName=test+homeDirectory=/home/test+loginShell=/bin/bash+sn=test+uid=test,ou=users",dc=home,dc=local   User Display Name: test User email: test@home.local LDAP Group   membership: jenkins LDAP Group lookup: successful (1 group) .
Openldap does not allow anonymous binding, hence admin credentials in jenkins config.
I would like to publish this dashboard to users with no access to Jenkins.
I am trying to change my Jenkins jobs regarding Sonarqube settings.
First do this either in Build Phase of Jenkins if using or set in /etc/profile: .
/pre/  I use Docker and /code/ image to run Jenkins.
But, since we already are using CA-Rally and Jenkins and a lot of plugins/hooks are already developed, there is maybe something that already exists that could fulfill my needs.
In terms of security, which option is better for handling permissions on a Jenkins EC2 instance, an instance profile or a IAM user with a role?
I would like to use the artifact of another build job in Jenkins.
My general container structure is: app, Jenkins, secure Nginx as reverse proxy (this is the only one exposed to the host), and now I want to add the registry container (because I gather this is the only way to run the swarm..or is it?)
GKE offers a marketplace with a click to deploy Jenkins image that I wanted to use but when I try to select my cluster it is marked as ineligible cluster with the message /code/.
We have been using Rebuilder plugin (/url/) on our Jenkins and see a lot of value with that.
I am trying to execute tests using JENKINS.
So I am trying to setup an automatic jenkins backup using git in the background.
I want to release a module via Jenkins that uses a dependency which is not only distinguished by its version but also by a custom classifier passed as a system property at build time.
Jenkins starts the docker container without a user (using the UID and GID), so you can start it with root (or add a new user in your Dockerfile which is better): .
/pre/  I instantiate Jenkins using the command: .
I should say I am using Jenkins-X.
If the pipeline should trigger automatically on tag creation (it seems like Jenkins supports that /url/) then I 'm wondering what additional configuration I could add to trigger the build automatically?
However, after starting to use Jenkins we are facing some problems.
Using the Without View link does n't seem to work for multibranch pipeline jobs as of writing (Jenkins 2.121.2; build status plugin 1.9): it genereates a link like: .
One option is to make use of Jenkins for Blue/Green deployments In this case jenkins will be one central place where you manage your deployments (but this is just an example, we do have quite a lot of tools build around this that may help you better based on your needs) .
It can be done eg on Jenkins side in /url/: .
However you 'll have the option to the merge commit done in bitbucket directly in which case you do not need to do the merge in Jenkins but need to switch to the PR branch instead.
/pre/  Using Jenkins Merge .
/pre/  Alternative Solution using Merge in Jenkins .
It could be something like this (I have a jenkins user setup on all server to deploy remotely).
The properties can easily be specified using the Jenkins UI, however the JobDSL does not have this option, meaning the configure block needs to be used.
We use Jenkins.
This is how I solved it configuring the Jenkins image context path without the need to use the ingress rewrite annotations: .
When you start your Jenkins container use /code/ to hand the host 's docker.sock to the container: .
/pre/  That way I am able to use Docker agents in my Jenkins.
I 'm trying to display MStest, Nunit3, Nunit2 results using Xunit Plugin and using Jenkins pipeline and have not been successful with the same.
/pre/  But Jenkins was configured to use: .
You must use the Jenkins pipeline /url/.
Having a Jenkins Docker image, I would like to add the complete 'npm' environment to that image.
I want to integrate gerrit with jenkins.
You mount the socket /code/ to the jenkins container in order to be able to use the docker from the host.
You run /code/ in order to add jenkins to the docker group.
The problem is that I want to generate an HTML report automatically in a Jenkins pipeline.
I would like my Jenkins job to run against many servers, but I do NOT want them to be predefined.
How can I create a Parameterized Jenkins Job that allows whoever is using it to  'dynamically add' a server list to the build params?
I used docker inside the Jenkins container so that it was possible to use anything by using a job configuration (or later - Jenkinsfiles).
Is there any way to change the jenkins global configuration programatically?
How can I make Jenkins use Bash rather than its native shell for just one Jenkins pipeline/Jenkinsfile?
My workaround is to ping pong the global setting for shell type depending on which Jenkins build I want to run.
I need to integrate them with Jenkins so that just with one click, the scripts starts execution.
I have workspace in my local, I want to use it as workspace in jenkins instance.
The first way that I understood is that, To install Jenkins master and slave.
The second way that I found that usage of Kubernetes plugin for Jenkins.If we using this way , Installing only master and configuring the plugin.
Is this standard way of using Jenkins in top of kubernetes cluster?
The easiest of which is using the Jenkins Credentials Plugin (can define either a key or file etc.)
I am currently using Jenkins RBAC plugin to grant access and permissions to project for the users with the Regex pattern that matches the job.
You should be using /code/ instead of /code/ in Jenkins pipelines on Windows.
Inside the container you need to have passwd, group and sudoers files that have the jenkins user.
The jenkins user needs to be setup to have password-less sudo (/code/).
We 're heavily using pipeline jobs in our Jenkins system and need to be able to parameterize the /code/ step using the /code/ job parameter.
You need to choose /code/ type after click /code/ on jenkins page, rather than choose /code/ type.
I 'm looking for a similar solution in Jenkins.
Is there a way i can change the user the jenkins run without losing existing jenkins data/cofig.
I tried changing the user in services.msc, however it crashed jenkins and was not able to load jenkins after changing user.
I am using Gearman plugin with Jenkins to provide higher availability.
In a jenkins declarative pipeline if I add a step like this: .
I am using a bit bucket repository for a jenkins based deployment.
Those suites are triggered with a jenkins job and now I need to make it optional to exclude a specific group or not.
I thought about adding an additional build parameter in jenkins and add a flag to the system properties if this parameter is set like so /code/.
1If you are planning to make deployments from Jenkins, you will certainly require more than the ability to list Pods, as you will be required to mutate objects in the system.
However, if you use Helm, it is Helm 's Tiller pod which influences the downstream k8s objects for your deployments, so the set of permissions you require for the Helm Tiller and for Jenkins to communicate with the Tiller will vary.
I would like to use C-spy debugger to perform unit testing and code coverage.Is there any way so that i can generate xml files and use it with jenkins to display the coverage report?
I have Jenkins working with OS X slave nodes using selenium over ssh.
/pre/  Change JENKINS_HOME in /etc/sysconfig/jenkins .
It is the method I use on my cluster, where the jenkins master can provision slave pods as needed, which makes much more sense than keeping slaves alive that are n't being used.
we set the CI/CD pipeline , where user need to raise Pull Request, after which jenkins pull the PR and trigger building process followed by automation.
Currently I have one Jenkinsfile and it is manually built using the Jenkins GUI.
I want to create a second Jenkinsfile that will also be built trough the Jenkins GUI but I do not know how to have both of these pipelines in the same branch and build whichever I want.
I 'm using jenkins emailext plugin, in the Jenkins global configuration UI, under /code/ section, I can set /code/ to be a list of recipients.
I use the jenkins with active choices parameter I need that groovy depends on my choice return area where I can write something I try this  .
/pre/  The issue that I am having is that I would like to parameterize the CucumberOptions through Jenkins, ideally setting the feature file or scenario name through a Jenkins choice parameter.
/pre/  Is there anything on the Jenkins side which needs enabling/configuring?
I would then be able to populate these parameters using the aws cli as part of the Jenkins build process.
I was hoping there would be a way to download all the dependent packages onto the docker image that is used to run Jenkins jobs.
I want to be able to connect from any jenkins host without having the certificates added to the keystore.
I 'm currently trying to configure Jenkins in order to launch my Windows slave using EC2 plugin.
I believe I used the standard setting of Jenkins and I am on Windows Platform, using Selenium and Java.
I have Jenkins master installed on Linux, i have created a  windows slave with Launch method as "Let Jenkins control this windows slave as a Windows Service".
Go to Jenkins -> "Configure system" and add the users or e-mails you want to exclude to "Excluded Recipients".
Description: when a admin user, logged in, he not able to see the "Manage Jenkins" option.
/pre/  I already used some jenkins plugin like EnvInjector and something similar.
In Jenkins, this pipeline can be built depending on a boolean check box for each step so we can choose what steps we wish to build.
You will now see the "Manage Jenkins" options.
/pre/  I am using Jenkins 2.121.1. .
you might be looking for the Jenkins /url/.
However, as the application built by the Jenkins is not able to do that.
I want to see it in Jenkins console without using of "script.echo".
On the /code/ section of the Build Triggers, enabling the checkbox:  Build every pull request automatically without asking enables the Jenkins job to add an update status to GitHub.
You just need to research what is the internal container port used by your jenkins and put it in docker run -p ... .
I want to know if my jenkins runs only with code from SCM or will it have access to containers?
I really like the log view of jenkins and asked myself how they are handling this.
I was facing a similar issue when I was trying to view the extent report from Jenkins.
From the main Jenkins page, click "Manage Jenkins" and then "Manage Plugins" or just navigate to: /url/.
You need to make the jenkins container privileged to access a device.
You can use the /url/ which also support Jenkins Pipeline jobs.
If you dont want to use docker on jenkins and you use java something like /url/ could do the trick.
I want to bind my docker binaries and docker.sock to my docker jenkins container so that i will be able to use docker inside jenkins.
Jenkins instance has 3 saved credentials, and from what I see, Jenkins loads the password when we click in "View Configuration" option for a job, even if your job does not use those credentials (e.g., using Source Code Management option).
I am trying create CI for my project using jenkins.
Choosing a checkbox allows me to create a pipeline similar to Jenkins.
The UI is n't as nice as Jenkins, but it suits my needs.
Since I also could n't find under Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> Configure System the Advanced option.
How can i do the same way from the Jenkins.
Do i have to add any code to capture this when i stop the Jenkins job.
/pre/  We want to automate this process, I mean, we 'd really like to avoid performing these three steps and we want to avoid to configure a docker client on a jenkins slave in order to push them.
It 's primary purpose is to attempt to convert existing non-Pipeline Jenkins jobs into Pipeline jobs, complete with an option to generate a Jenkinsfile which is in turn committed to source control.
Turns out in a Jenkins pipeline I ca n't use /code/.
The Jenkins requires an Authentication with User/PW, once done, it uses cookies.
This empty account is used to set up any access tokens or GitHub credentials Jenkins may need.
I just wonder if there is a way Jenkins declarative pipeline allow me use the real execution status to set currentBuild.result.
My goal is to create a Jenkins Pipeline Input Step where the user can choose from a selection of JIRA versions.
I am not able to see login and signup option in Jenkins home page,was able to see those option every time but all of a sudden this is missing and every time anyone runs any build it shows as anonymous triggered the build , I want to stop this  .
I would like to use Jenkins plugin "Publish Performance test result report" to parse the jmeter.log after the test, but there is this field "Summariser Date Format" in the plugin that needs to fill in.
This is also the standard approach offered by jenkins, i.e.
then use the credential id in the Jenkins file.
I am trying to define Jenkins pipelines as (shared) objects, as done /url/.
Adding Jenkins user to Root Group did n't help.
I am new to Jenkins and have set it up with 4 slaves and trying to run Cucumbers (Capybara+Selenium+Firefox) in vncserver(tried xvfb as well) mode.
This way you can configure Jenkins to use the Docker API instead of the socket.
You need to say explicitly the container to use the /code/ network because you want to expose both Jenkins and Docker API.
Is there any way I could set the name for the Jenkins build with the timestamp?
while trying to build restbed for our needs and integrate this into jenkins i struggled a bit with openssl builds.
A new window will pop up, select Hudson(supports Jenkins) and click Next.
I did the following: Services > Jenkins > Right Click - Properties > Log On tab > Changing it from 'Local System Account' to 'This Account'.
I cannot do it using Jenkins.
When I enter container with Jenkins using: /code/ and doing /code/ I receive message .
Is it possible to get Jenkins build duration using scripts or using some inbuilt functionality.
But how can one display this information in the Jenkins UI console to a Slack channel?
Here I recommend you install Jenkins by 'Homebrew' if you want to deal with iOS project building,because you may meet some errors that the way of using /code/ to install,it 's really hard to solve the problems.
so i want to make my automation running in jenkins job.
All you need to do is specify this in the /code/ of your jenkins slave with /code/, like so: .
I am using Jenkins to do a build, and I need to get a list of files.
I 've configured the VM as a Jenkins slave using ssh to login as the /code/ user.
/pre/  As I mentioned, the jenkins user has been added to the docker group and Docker has been added to /code/ (/code/): .
It 's probably not on the /code/ for the jenkins user.
I have a file with say a list of items (Kernels) which keeps changing everyday and I would like to setup Jenkins to do the following: .
/pre/  I suppose Jenkins has to run the /code/ image, and also the /code/ image and link them together (to be able to access mongodb).
I want to list all the builds ever invoked in all of Jenkins, ordered chronologically descending.
I 'm now trying to research to see if I can pass the build number from Jenkins into fastlane via gym and update my xcargs.
I am trying to use the same Jenkinsfile for 2 different Jenkins jobs.
I am currently using /url/as my Jenkins solution.
I am using /url/ to write our Jenkins job configuration.
I am trying to get similar metrics using Graphite on Jenkins but I could not find a way to do this.
We use these features with our internal GitHub and Jenkins server and it works very well.
Here is my understanding that I have to write a back hand code using Jenkins plugin.
Now, how to add the front end page like my custom page in Jenkins.
I wonder the origins of this design for the Jenkins behavior.
also, you need to set the jenkins env.
In addition, it happens no matter if I launch tests from Jenkins or directly from the machine itself, by either using /code/ command or Xcode test button.
I have a Jenkins-job which possibly has more than 100 choices for a parameter(param1) and based on that param2,param3,etc will be changing.
Webservers and apps vary wildly in how they handle this, and I have no idea if Jenkins cares.
You have to configure Jenkins with the Sonar variables you want it to use.
/pre/  Changing the Jenkins user to /code/ did n't work.
Needs configuration for github user in Jenkins Credentials and requires node allocation for sending http request via curl.
I am new with Jenkins, And I have create simple freestyle job that automate what I am doing manualy.
I am new to Jenkins (other than calling builds in the browser UI).
How would I make a Jenkins job that would receive a simple JSON name-value pair like .
I need to implement Https for the Jenkins server.
i want to create database dynamically using Jenkins after deployment and before deployment also.
so can anyone suggest me how to create database using Jenkins or if there is third party tool or plugin is available in Jenkins ?
Then go to Jenkins --> manage Jenkins --> github settings --> add user --> Select secret text ** --> **paste the token  .
When jenkins creates the docker image it gives it a random long tag and I 'd like to replace that with my own tag.
Using Jenkins directly, it is possible to run images as "sidecar containers" (as their docs mention), something like: .
Since I 'm running Jenkins inside openshift, it does n't have permissions to use docker.
Add the /code/ keyword when accessing Jenkins internals which are not serializable.
For completeness: In addition to that of course for accessing the Jenkins internals you need to switch of the sandbox mode or put your code into a global shared library.
You can list all available nodes and check the configurations for each one in Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes.
So i need to make decision based on the parameter that is configured in jenkins job ( Through this project is parametrized option)  .
I have written this script where only authenticated users can access Jenkins: .
/pre/  Now, I want to configure this matrix plugin in a way that nobody can access the Jenkins settings area(even authenticated users can not access the Jenkins settings).
I want to run a jenkins image.
I have looked many places for how to set the usage property in jenkins using python.
The obvious solution to this is Docker containers (we have specialized Docker images for each one) and ideally we would want to tell Jenkins to execute each  unittest in a Docker container that we specify beforehand.
/pre/  This allows for the actual Jenkins agent to spin up a docker container to do the work.
You can achieve what you want with jenkins pipeline plugin.
I would like to set up a Jenkins based CI system, where the job histories are dynamically managed based on the parameters coming from webhook triggers.
I do not know if any of this is achievable with currently available Jenkins plugins, or if I have to implement something from scratch?
I have a local setup of Jenkins on Tomcat on Windows and able to achieve Active Directory integration using /url/.
/pre/  Step 3: Create the secret text and define your values Client_Id = "12345", Client_Secret = "54321" using Credentials Plugin(which you will find it on the left side of Jenkins, where you will create a new job).
So long story short, if you are working with SAM its better you have your Sys admin give you permissions to Create role, and you will need other permissions as well, or have the deployment of the SAM template done by a Job runner like Jenkins (that has the permissions).
Use a language of your choice to consume Jenkins Restful API to get the json for the build and deserialise.
My goals is clone and manipulate Virtual Machine (Salt Minion)  Using Jenkins to make call to SaltMaster witch making call to vmWare vCentre(Vshpere).
Different users get different permissions, so also make sure the /code/ command is available for the users Jenkins is operating under .
Go to Manage Jenkins.
However, make sure your Jenkins is running on Windows if you want to use /code/ syntax.
You shall not use /code/ in Jenkins pipelines.
The action I want to perform is connecting to that instance and perhaps performing a touch command to check connectivity through JENKINS PIPELINE.
Now I am trying to add the GitHub user groups to jenkins Assign Roles to give access to users but i am getting the fallowing error .
In this specific case, I want to use Jenkins secret file credentials as input parameter to my plugin, so I can secure the secret keys.
It is possible to change the permission by using an init container, while defining the slave pod you can include one init container that mount the volume as root and change the permission to jenkins user.
I would like to do it per code and not in the manage jenkins tab.
Attaching the real phone to my Jenkins (I cannot do that as I have no physicall access to Jenkins virtual machine + on a real device I would not be able to control the mock at all) .
Go To ->Manage Jenkins -> Configure Global Security -> Plugin Manager and check the box for Use browser for metadata download.
I 've got the same problem, and I just solve in this way: I found that Jenkins Server will execute the cmd with an user which differ to your built machine user.
There used to be a way for an anonymous user - such as a script - to query certain aspects of Jenkins via its REST API.
I 'm using Jenkins with ADS authentication.
I thought about creating a special "auto" user, and creating a token for that user, but the Active Directory config seems to prevent me from creating new Jenkins users.
Using a Jenkins Pipeline, I want to replace this line with  .
Is this possible in Jenkins?
See /url/ on how to add users to the Jenkins database with authentication already enabled.
One way to do that will be using Jenkins (or any other CI).
we use Jenkins/gerrit together to achieve the goal.
1. gerrit trigger jenkins for patchset-create.
In my opinion using max executors per build agent is not the right way to do that because if your Jenkins cluster scales you will have to adjust stuff.
Is it possible to combine multiple shared Jenkins libraries?
I read through many docker jenkins integration documents and white paper, I did n't come across this scenario, does it mean not possible :(  .
If not, I would suggest you to use Jenkins for triggering the execution and takes care of email part.
Unfortunately the job only runs when I manually hit the button "Trigger Jenkins" button in the Webhook settings.
I am using Jenkins for deployment, now on every deployment I need to clone the app and run /code/ every time.
I am trying to pass more than nine parameters from Jenkins to JMeter4.0.
I resolved it by allowing anonymous access to Jenkins (the option is available in /code/ page, /code/ section - we use Kerberos Single Sign-On plugin for Jenkins authentication, so not sure how would other authentication plugins work).
I want to stop a Jenkins build that is happening on my localhost using the terminal.
Is there another way of stopping a Jenkins build securely?
I have to migrate from jenkins to gitlab and I would like to be able to use dynamic job names in order to have some information directly in the pipeline summary without having to click on each job etc.... in jenkins we can immediately see the parameters passed to our job and this is not the case in gitlab-ci.
You can use credentials plugin to store credentials in Jenkins.
Once you have this plugin, you should be able to add credentials of following type in Jenkins and use the credential id in your pipeline:   .
TL;DR: It could be done, but appears it would require work that nobody has taken-on that I can find, and appears that generally that feature of graphite should not be used excessively because graphite does n't appear to store it efficiently (although Jenkins usage seems like a very reasonable usage of it) .
I have been trying to get my CC toolchain on an EFS mount so my jenkins slaves can use them.
i am new in terraform and jenkins, i have create docker image, which i have pushed in ecs with the help of ecs-cli and i have also created a another instance for graylog (/url/), now i want to send java system logs to graylog instance, for that i need to do some changes in java container and which require graylog instance ip.
What is the easiest way to store passwords, SSH private keys and AWS access_keys/secret_keys on the Jenkins machine?
When you run Jenkins from within container configuration is a little harder as probably you need to map host 's docker daemon socket to Jenkins container so he can start docker containers on host or you need to use docker-in-docker feature but please take a look on that article: /url/ .
I tried using Jenkins parameterised trigger plugin but was n't able to pass shell variables.
Go to  Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Global properties .
After adding these you may need to restart Jenkins.
If you want to execute a build job present in Jenkins B, then you have to give the API token of Jenkins B.
I recommend that you create a web server that listens on two network interfaces: one public, routable IP address that can be reached by Github; and a non-routable, LAN only address that can talk to your LAN-installed Jenkins.
You could directly expose your Jenkins host via a public IP address, but it is a best practice to put jenkins behind a proxy like a web server.
I assume that you want to trigger a Jenkins build.
How about simply using the Jenkins REST API.
I am trying to use Jenkins Credentials plugin to get user input and make use of it in Jenkinsfile for processing.
If you want to log in as Jenkins, you can do so with  .
However, I have a fundamental question on whether I should proceed with installing Docker inside the running Jenkins Docker container (to use that as the base image) or not.
My end goal is to create 2 types of Jenkins jobs that do the following -  .
I 'm trying to send an email in Jenkins.
You should be able to open a browser and point it to /code/, where you should see the Jenkins UI.
Now, if you want to see the logs (for instance, to get the Jenkins-generated password), you can use: .
use a pseudo TTY in Jenkins .
I 'm trying to run a batchscript present inside the workspace of jenkins.
How can I make this run externally without the end user having to sign-in as I would be triggering this from Jenkins/Python?
And I created a Jenkins slave using this image./url/ .
I am trying to see allure results on Jenkins.
I am using from my jenkins  .
I should add that Im using active directory for auth so these are n't internal jenkins users they are AD users.
EDIT: I am trying to use the Jenkins Artifactory plugin Below is the Artifactory settings we use for our Java projects and it works.
I 'm trying to store my GPG private key in Jenkins so that I can use it to sign rpm packages and repositories.
Where is the best place to store a GPG private key in Jenkins?
I am hoping to use the built in /code/ variables that Jenkins provides.
Or if theres a better way to add step in jenkins stage?

Thing is in our regular builds (even Jenkins) we never use git lfs and when we use App Center, I think we are forced to use the agent which then uses lfs.
/code/I 'm trying to use jenkins ec2 plugin and I have problems with performance.
then, I use local windows user jenkins for connect from master to windows slave ec2 instance.
This value is used to let   Jenkins know how to refer to itself, ie.
I have a Jenkins parameterized build called "deploy-job", and I use the Extensible Choice option set to System Groovy Choice Parameter.
You do have to possibility to define the jenkins user on your webappserver or you can use a different user and define this user then in the jenkins credentials.
We too have similar requirement, considering the network dependency and limit on parallel execution we installed agents in the respective boxes and we do local deployments using the Jenkins slave .
As previously mentioned Jenkins does not allow anonymous access (you do n't want people to trigger builds for you!).
1) If your Jenkins is behind a VPN, you need to make sure that your Jenkins webhooks URL are exposed .
Jenkins is aimed to execute shell commands in background mode, not for interactive mode.
Anyway, linux is the best choice to host jenkins.
We have set up a Pipeline in Jenkins but I 'm unsure of the best way (or best practice) to include the tests as part of the pipeline.
C. I read that people use Cobertura, jest-junit, etc to have unit tests and coverage within Jenkins - what is the best?
So, for /code/ URLs, you need to align filesystem mounts and permissions between CLI user/machine and Jenkins master user/machine.
For CI/CD workflow, Can I use Jenkins to Connect Microsoft CRM and do import new CRM solutions and adding security roles to users, Create plugins?
So, the idea with something like Jenkins is that you should be using it to do all of your build and processing on a build system.

Once you do, they 'll show on the job build view in Jenkins.
after cleaning workspace folder in Jenkins or some version control system actions will reset this setting to default, and non-working option will select again.
Then you should be able to access your Jenkins.
Then you can use git and jenkins for example to handle some typical ci tasks.
You can still use Jenkins, With Windows service: /url/ .
These requirements apply to all components of the Jenkins system including Jenkins master, all types of agents, CLI clients, and other components.
After discovering in the documentation that these updates are not possible if the Role resource is named, I tried removing the name, and received a permissions failure related to the Jenkins user attempting to create the role.
I had half a thought to delete the role in a separate Jenkins step using the aws cli, but was scared away by the behavior of /code/ and existing instances (these should be non-interrupted updates).
/pre/  My job also uses other credentials stored in Jenkins, and they can be appended this way: .
I want to expose the Jenkins build log as part of the Post Build Actions.
So, this is Jenkins allowing a Java implementation to allow it to set it 's behavior for Groovy.

/pre/  Use Jenkins' Global Tools .
Containerised Jenkins worker allow for the usual maintenance benefits: easy migration, scaling, reset .
You are not supposed to use the /code/ if you want to get to the jenkins endpoint.
I set up the pipeline so that the scripts grab and decrypt the correct passwords from git using the Jenkins shell command like this: .
In case of docker solutions, jenkins must be able to connect to docker host in order to execute docker commands like docker build, run , etc .
Jenkins will just build or launch this image /code/ sending parameters like git_url, etc.
Detect git push event using webhook configurations in jenkins: (/url/) .
When push event is detected, jenkins must detect programming language of repository and will launch your cool docker image of Approach 3. .
Remember, by default, Jenkins on install allows anonymous access.
You should lock down access using the /url/ plugin and maybe also using the /url/ plugin although using Jenkins own users is ok to start with.
The Ops team will have control of Jenkins master eventually, but since my team is the first needing this, we are setting it up.
This is a single pane of glass management console that allows organizations or large teams to centrally manage the jenkins environment.
Scaleability:  CloudBees leverages Kubernetes to provide organizations with the ability to elastically scale Jenkins environments as needed.
Security:  CloudBees allows organizations to install Roll Based Access Control within Jenkins.
CloudBees is regularly adding enhancements to further differentiate themselves from Jenkins Open Source and make themselves more appealing to large enterprise requirements.
On top of the above, CloudBees has developed a presentation layer that rides on top of Jenkins for SDLC pipeline, CD monitoring, and metric tracking called DevOptics.
Since there is no way we could urlEncode on the password obtained from the Jenkins credential plugin.
The resolution was to provide access do docker without sudo (create a group docker, add the (Jenkins) user to the group, set the group on /var/run/docker.sock).
Probably in Jenkins post build activity I just want to perform merge activity.
Our Jenkins needs to be able to build other containers.
I 'm looking for another way to manage users roles in Jenkins.
Are there any REST APIs exposed by Jenkins to create and delete a user?

I am trying to have Jenkins pipline job run only using specific agents.
I have an idea, which might be somewhat hacky: Build a custom docker container based on the original Jenkins container and add an extra step to your docker file.
I find it easy to implement such setup thanks to a Jenkins job.
And I now face the following question: is there a way to trigger that Jenkins job only once after system/jenkins boot ?
Groovy scripts are powerful in that you can hook into the Jenkins API itself to get any information you want or need.
If the fields you want to extract are parts of external plugins, there is probably no example for them but they are available to Jenkins' Groovy as well.
We use the Jenkins Label Expression to lets Jenkins choose which job can be run on which node.
b. currently we need a predeployed application which can differ between different inputs => no equivalent of Jenkins Label Expression .
A much better alternative for building Jenkins jobs via the GUI is making them as Jenkins pipelines.
you could add /url/ to Jenkins to get JMeter support.
How do i update jenkins job configuration  programatically using java ?
Our jenkins instance is also in a subnet that prevents outgoing SSH so we have to use HTTPS.

Even if you change the /code/ in the Dockerfile, Jenkins will use an assigned workspace inside the container as when you run a build in a normal agent.
You can choose to let Jenkins create the token on your behalf, or create it manually.
Let Jenkins create the token: this option is only available if you are not using two-factor authentication.
You can make Jenkins generate the token by going to Advanced > Manage Additional GitHub Actions > Convert Login and Password to token.
I was able to configure the Google Login Plugin on Jenkins 2.138.2 and I am able to successfully authenticate against our Gsuite domain.
Currently all authenticated users of my domain have the ability to do anything within jenkins.
Of those 70 users, only about 30 should have the ability to access jenkins and of those 30 only 5 should have full admin rights.
My intention is to check I can run in headless mode fine locally and then I want to get it running also in Chrome headless mode on a linux Jenkins node, where we are currently using XVFB but its proving to be too flaky with timeouts in tests for example.
It is a useful tool allowing to display global jenkins/hudson build trend over time.
For that I need to take artifact list and deploy server list into Jenkins UI.

It  merely acts as a wrapper so that the Jenkins Console Output correctly displays colors, the plugin itself does not add ANSI escape sequences nor colors to the Console Output.
How do I set up Jenkins to allow manual on-demand clearing of the workspace?
I 'd prefer not to follow the  'ssh in and delete the directory manually' option because not all Jenkins users have ssh access.
/code/ is not set in the jenkins users /code/, jenkins uses the /code/ executable configured for the job.
Then in the new jenkins just /code/ in the global settings (admin access is required) should be enough, if not, then you will need to restart Jenkins tool.
click on Add Webhook check your Jenkins job by making some event in GitHub.
Now go to Jenkins > Credentials > System > Global credentials (unrestricted) > Add Credentials .
I 'm trying to use a clean workspace for every Jenkins job and someone is logged on the Jenkins agent and has left the workspace folder open or it is open in command prompt, The Jenkins job always fails while cleaning up the workspace as it 's in use and I need Jenkins to delete the folder even when it 's use forcefully instead of failing.
I know there are more elegant ways to do this but I do n't wish to introduce all the infrastructure and extra maintenance work around deploying /code/ to artifactory and having extra jenkins pipeline, etc... .

Yes, if you disable the project in Jenkins, webhook will not be able to trigger the job .
Yes, you can use build step to trigger any project (job) you want in Jenkins.
So when all of them click button in email or link Then is It should trigger the jenkins job build.
It looks like the plugin creates a job queue that can be accessed by multiple Jenkins masters and serviced by multiple build agents.
Jenkins has long shipped with an embedded Groovy engine to provide advanced scripting capabilities for admins and users alike.
As it is a fully featured programming environment, Scripted Pipeline offers a tremendous amount of flexibility and extensibility to Jenkins users.
I know it 's possible to have that when using Jenkins inside of Openshift, but when using pure build images it seems full CI/CD seems to be missing.
I am trying to find solution for the jenkins nodes to automatically connect to master in non headleass mode.
I was able to use composer cache by creating a volume between my Jenkins machine and the Docker image.

Running jobs can be found based on color categorization called anime, using the below Jenkins API.
I am aware that I can set a global environment variable in Manage Jenkins --> Configure System --> Global properties.
And also make sure that Jenkins has enabled anonymous read access: .
For this to work, your Jenkins has to allow anonymous read access   (specifically, "Job > Read" access) to the system.
If access control   to your Jenkins is more restrictive, you may need to specify the   username and password, depending on how your authentication is   configured.
I 've read in several places that it 's possible to set the status of a jenkins build to the desired value (e.g.
Suppose, we need to run another container (ContainerA) inside Jenkins docker container, docker pipeline plugin will use /code/ to mount Jenkins container volume to ContainerA.
If you trying to use /code/ or /code/ to map specific directory in Jenkins container to ContainerA, you will got an unexpected behavior.
When using /code/ the only thing that I need to do is to provide the /code/ parameter in order to pick the service account that allows Jenkins to do that but seems like /code/ only works with config files and that creates a race condition when several jobs are running simultaneously because it will all depend on the configuration present in /code/.
As you mentioned you are using Chrome headless mode on a linux Jenkins node you need consider a few factors as follows: .
We use the junit reporter for jenkins.
/Users/JacquelineGeorge/Documents/Jenkins/LocatorTraining&amp;&amp;npm run   protractor .

I am trying to setup group authorizations using my IDP (Identity Provider) with the Jenkins instance I have.
I am able to login to my Jenkins successfully using my SAML credentials.
But what Im looking for is rather than having to assign roles to users on the Jenkins layer, I want Jenkins to pull groups defined in my IDP and assign those groups to roles that Ive defined rather than me having to assign roles to individual users.
All I want to do is to have my Jenkins reads those group IDs.
Now I need to be able to create a Jenkins Declarative pipeline to build the same project.
I just want to do a build in Openshift using the jenkins pipeline (using jenkins ephemeral inside Openshift) to see how things work.
I am trying to create three different jenkins jobs for a single code base.
Unfortunately I do n't want to unlock more build processors in Jenkins but want to know why Jenkins always uses 2 build cores for this job.
I want to integrate my tests with Jenkins so I can schedule my run.
The way to go when using Jenkins is to create an environment variable in your slave or your job, call it /code/ and give it the /code/ option: .
I am trying to run jenkins swarm agent using the docker-compose provided /url/.
To give example, I am providing 2 simple jenkinsfiles, which works fine in jenkins pipeline way of implementation.

I 've been dealing with this same issue, and we have decided to expose the script to the users using Jenkins.
I am trying to write Jenkins /url/ scripts in Groovy that use the /url/.
The Jenkins has no trouble using the HTTP proxy in other contexts, e.g.
We are trying to scan our docker images using Anchore Engine Jenkins plugin.
But in my experience, I will use the /url/ to build a image through Jenkins and pass the username and password with arg to the dockerfile to build the image and execute the docker compose.
However, I want the script to run without interruption (I do n't think Jenkins even allows you to enter user passwords when running bash scripts?
What are the specific integration steps between git and jenkins that need to be put in place to enable this hook on pull requests.
You should use Jenkins.
Going with option A would mean that your docker and Jenkins machine need to hold the same infra for such builds which is not common, to say the least.
I access my jenkins via browser using /code/ so I set my Jenkins URL to /code/.

In my new job we are looking into moving to Gitlab CI, since we already use it for other things and we do n't have too many builds set up in Jenkins, so the move should not be too painful.
Out of the box Jenkins supports a quicksearch over the build history that matches by label (description).
If you want canned filters and convenient saved views, the widely used workaround at the moment seems to be to use the Jenkins Job Builder, a job template plugin, etc, to spawn lots of similar jobs.
/pre/  and I have also added my credentials into Jenkins .

I have been running selenium tests in jenkins using a node with launching mode: Launch agent via webstart.
Currently, I have created a docker outside docker image for handling my Jenkins agent which will perform auto restarts without using supervisor as a solution ( lack of python 3.7 support ), and by that, since I 'm using /code/ as base image and I do n't want to install any additional dependencies I opted to compensate the lack of tools like /code/ and /code/, or others for checking if the process is running or not, by writing the started process pid on a file which will be used for validating if the process exists or not under the path /code/.

Jenkins has the ability to upload new jobs via its REST API.
Or, alternatively, is it possible to directly upload the /code/ to the Jenkins REST API to create the job?
Jenkins needs to run as root to allow it to use the top level docker socket.
Also, the docker socket I 'm passing in does n't use the user groups of the jenkins slave node because ubuntu user has access to run docker, however even after adding it to the docker group inside the docker image my agent is running from it still gives me permission issues when I do n't specifically run  the docker agent as root.

The two key pieces you need to support this are a Docker registry (Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, Google GCR, run your own) and a continuous integration system (Jenkins is popular or there are a bajillion cloud-based ones).
What is the user id of your Jenkins user?
As far as I remember if your jenkins user has ID 1000 then you need not override the user, because the default node docker image has a user with 1000 as an ID and there shouldn’t be any file permission issue(for deleting files).
All you need to ensure is both jenkins user on host is either same as in the container or container has a root user.
But I want to be able to hit my Jenkins by simply entering /url/ .

I 'm trying to get access to the credentials stored in Jenkins without having to hardcode them in the script itself.
I want to update Jenkins plugin via Artifactory.
A relatively safe way to handle this situation is to store your credentials is the credentials system in Jenkins (that way you do not have to include the credentials in the JenkinsFile), and using a deploy token (available for Gitlab 10.7 and later) for the relevant repository.
To add new global credentials to your Jenkins instance: .
If required, ensure you are logged in to Jenkins (as a user with the Credentials > Create permission).
the Dashboard of the Jenkins classic UI), click Credentials > System on the left.
System - if the credential/s to be added is/are for the Jenkins instance itself to interact with system administration functions, such as email authentication, agent connection, etc.
In the ID field, specify a meaningful credential ID value - for example, jenkins-user-for-xyz-artifact-repository.
However, for the benefit of all users on your Jenkins instance, it is best to use a single and consistent convention for specifying credential IDs.
If you do not specify its value, Jenkins assigns a globally unique ID (GUID) value for the credential ID.

I am trying to configure a Jenkins pipeline via jenkinsfile to have a parameterized build (the purpose, for example, is to run a subset of testsuites when certain flag is set to 'on').
I came across the below article on 'parameterized Jenkins pipeline', and it says by adding the 'properties' step I can achieve what I need.
Is there a way to keep both buttons, or similar approach to enable the automatic build to use default 'properties' value when triggered by code commit, while user can sometime trigger the build manually by inputting the 'properties' value in Jenkins UI?
/pre/  Because the ansible playbook try to do a /code/, I understand that user jenkins need to be able to connect to docker.

Jenkins pipeline exposes more control on such things.
I ran into this while trying to get my jenkins container set up to build docker containers as the jenkins user.
And here you have two different ways to call with user and token to Jenkins.
If Jenkins is actually creating the command-line for you, then you have to figure out how to tell it to not use the /code/ option.
Another option is to save test dump of test results and just send or read a text from the file it can be possibly easier for that i suggest you to look at : /url/ or if you use jenkins i suggest to use plugin for email notification 's.
The context is saved on this, and I can access all Jenkins plugins abilities from there .

However as you are using jenkins and pipelines you might be happy with the following alternative solution: .
Once Jenkins supports   detecting ZFS capabilities, rather than relying on the SunOS check,   the above caveats for ZFS integration with Jenkins should be   considered.
I used  /code/ to change the default back to the jenkins user 's login keychain.
/pre/  #  I 'm going to use a docker to drive Jenkins at the centos7.
Btw, you might also want to create a symbolic link (/code/) from jenkins volume mount dir to your own $WORKDIR.
This allows you to browse the workspace via the Jenkins UI etc.

I notice these security realm settings changing, when I jump between SAML and jenkins managed users via the UI, in the config.xml of Jenkins.
The Jenkins pipeline is run as user /code/ and this user is added to the docker group.
I want to run the TestCafe in firefox browser(not headless) through Jenkins.
/code/ and /code/ this selected user must exist on Jenkins internal DB right?
I think that this is the most correct/best practice way about using if/else or control logic within your Jenkins Declarative pipeline.
This works as needed, however the URL in use contains my Jenkins credentials and I 'd like to make this more secure.
Is there a way to generate a token of sorts in Jenkins instead of providing my username and password?
i am just trying to understand is there way to do this in jenkins pipeline.
I do n't prefer plugins, it would be nice to do it declarative way using jenkins file.
When viewed in Jenkins (via node => system information) it looks like this: .
I checked /code/ and have not found /code/, so Jenkins cannot be forced to specific language - or it can be other way?
I am trying to use the npm request module to make a post request to trigger a jenkins job.
I would be happy to use any other way to make the Jenkins job happy.
Basically Jenkins runs the docker container with the user 1002 and there is no user defined.
Openshift provides Jenkins /url/ of three types,  .
In Openshift, Jenkins runs as /url/( running the docker container inside), and you want to get the docker within the container.
you have to create a jenkins slave image by extending the base image and add docker to it .
Fortunately, it turns out manually initiating the SCM scan is n't even needed if you have github webhooks set up for your jenkins.
Now I want to set up an automated check (maybe a git hook or Jenkins job) so that people do n't add additional warnings.
However, we are using Jenkins for CI so i want use /code/ cli to create zip file so jenkins can execute that command and create zip file.)
But this Jenkins job is configured to use the /code/ as the /code/.
If /code/ IS configured through Jenkins to use /code/, do we need to include the /code/steps/code/SCM` function of Jenkins?
I 'm developing an application that has multiple components that are all pulled together and built using Jenkins Declarative Pipelines.
However, is there a way to monitor all the Codebuild builds in a single dashboard, like a monitor dashboard in Jenkins?
I want to migrate the Jenkins jobs from one server to the other, please suggest how to do it manually.
Once AD Authentication is configured in Jenkins and appropriate groups created in AD you can do a one-time setup of those groups with the Role-Based Strategy plugin in Jenkins and define what those groups have authorization to do.
Warning:  Be very careful when switching over from Jenkins own database user authentication to AD authentication.
I am aware of the REST API that Jenkins use, but our setup does not allow that directly; so the main mean for me to trigger jobs is through this library.
What is the benefit of implementing Active Directory based Security to servers like Jenkins?
How do I get Jenkins to use the changed triggers without running the job manually?
I think the question can be extended to any declarative job definition changes really, how do I get jenkins to update job settings without being forced to run the job.
I 'm looking for a plugin, or a built in way to make Jenkins automatically add a token at the very beginning of all build logs, and then and then a different token at the very end of the build log.
Yes, but make sure to use an LTS verson of Jenkins.
As a sample, if I do it via Jenkins it is pretty straightforward, but unfortunately I 'm not allowed to use anything apart from gitlab ci/cd.
Can anybody let me know what configuration we need to set it to launch (Chrome) browser in using Jenkins with Katalon studio.
To be current with Jenkins, you probably want to keep a /url/ in your repo and keep the configuration there .
And yes, you can use Jenkins, Travis etc.
I can either just rebuild the app  with Jenkins like .
The key is that every repository should call a JenkinsSharedLibrary, which gives you the possibility to maintain your jenkins builds in one central source, instead of having multiple "hardcoded" jenkinsfiles per repository.
This article describes the use case of a shared library and how to use Jenkins across multiple git repos.
When configuring node restrictions based on labels for freestyle jobs in the jenkins web interface, you can do this with the expression /code/.
/pre/  It works good on that Jenkins slave, but I wanted to add another Jenkins slave for SOAPUI test cases.
If you have a more complex security setup that allows some users to only configure jobs, but not administer Jenkins, you need to prevent them from running builds on the master node, otherwise they have unrestricted access into the JENKINS_HOME directory.
We would like to use Jenkins notifications, so developers would be automatically notified for example when a build gets broken.
Basically, we just need a small window to pop up on developers' screens when something goes wrong in Jenkins.
For example, on my instance of Jenkins, for the "GitHub Pull Request Builder" trigger type, after clicking the Advanced button, you can see an "Excluded regions" textbox with the following help description: .
Moreover, Jenkins has added functionality like this in various ways as discussed in resolved Jira tickets such as /url/ and /url/.
/pre/  And check Jenkins status (should be 'active'): .
/pre/  This is the only way to I get it to work with Jenkins.
I am able to integrate with Jenkins using MSTest.exe but when i am trying to Run my UI Testscripts , i am stuck as i am not able to open my Site.
Create the docker group and jenkins user: .
Finally I add the jenkins user to the docker group.
/pre/  By supplying the /code/ flag, you override the user /code/ that jenkins forces on you when you use the declarative pipeline.
When the image is running, the command will switch to a jenkins user that is allowed to access the underlying unix socket.
I have a new Jenkins slave set up on which I call Unity CLI to build using my custom build method:  .
The easiest thing to do is start up a Jenkins instance, configure it the way I want, /code/ into it (e.g., /code/), /code/ into /code/, and just grab the appropriate files and base64 encode them.
Jenkins indeed supply a /code/ DSL which can be directly used in /code/.
/pre/  Note: If the custom docker registry need credentails, you have to add your account for custom docker registry into Jenkins via Jenkins Credentials.
After adding, Jenkins will assign a id for your account, the id called credentialsId which used in above code.
I am trying to set an environment variable in Jenkins that I want my python script in Github to use.
The other way to look at this assumes that you wish to "go forward": that Jenkins itself has done the /code/ operation.
Is it possible to skip jenkins job if there is a specific word in the COMMIT_MSG?
I 'm setting up a UFT Testcase, where I need to login to Jenkins and perform few operations like creating new jobs.
There 's /code/ setting under /code/ menu at least in Jenkins 2.150.1. .
I 'm not a big fan of Jenkins Python API and to be honest, I even did n't use it once.
/pre/  Jenkins by default has /url/ enabled which prevents /url/.
Disable Prevent Cross Site Request Forgery exploits checkbox in Jenkins Configure Global Security (Not recommended) .
Above script will need only minor modifications to use jenkins crumb: .
I am using Groovy script to pull the data from oracle DB from Jenkins Job/Combo Box.
I have a (secret text) jenkins credential with a basic password, that I am attempting to compare to the string entered on build start.
For users, we have exposed a Dashboard on top on Jenkins APIs.
When the user clicks on the button, the jenkins logs page pops up in an iFrame.
1) Using TBD, How many pipelines are required using Jenkins?
At a high level, it basically comes down to configuring your Jenkins job so that it can be triggered remotely and creating a new Slack command that triggers the Jenkins job.
Jenkins Blueocean docker image is based on Alpine Linux (Found this by running /code/ from inside the image via /url/).
EDIT The alternative and much better way would be to use a separate maven docker container as Jenkins agent as suggested in the tutorial documentation /url/: .
I do n't know the rule Jenkins determine to use which user to running your script.
/pre/  i have pasted ssh private and public keys which is being used by bitbucket in /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/ and i have also configured /code/ in following way.
(I do not admin this Jenkins instance, so my access is limited in that respect.)
I am trying to trigger a Jenkins build from Slack and it looks like I might have to write new Middleware.
I 'm using Jenkins ver.
I updated jenkins to version 2.15 and seems like "summary display plugin" is not working, Summary display plugin is used to show the results of the current build on the build page.
I would like to update a chef role attribute from Jenkins.
This doesn’t seem like a feasible solution from Jenkins.
Using curl on ubuntu I am trying to fetch the Jenkins version inspired by: .
/pre/  The thing is I need to use the gerrit user specified in our jenkins credentials, because he has the right to push and stuff.
You can use the jenkins /url/.
I want to write an ansible playbook using bit bucket rest api, which creates a webhook to trigger a jenkins pipeline with every merge.
1.user will give the GIT commit ID using the Jenkins parameterized option.
I want to share screenshot of time zone settings of Jenkins  where I would get it.
I am able to connect to both private registries from Jenkins and I can pull the image I want to, however I do n't know how to push that same image to a different repo.
/pre/     I am using a Jenkins container on my local Windows machine.
If you need to set the timezone for Jenkins, you can specify it in the start command: /url/ .
Just navigate to Manage Jenkins -> Configure System and scroll down to the OpenShift Client Plugin settings:  .
I also have this same use case, trying to publish the report in Jenkins with HTML Publisher plugin.
/code/ is optional, but is the recommended way to allow your jenkins instance to spin up other docker containers.
/code/ is also optional, but allows your jenkins container to be able to run the docker binary.
In either case, you may want to use a Dockerfile to create a new Jenkins docker image.
You should now be able to access the jenkins webportal via https with no port specifier (since port 443 is default for https) .
I have a scenario that, based on few conditions i need to set the Jenkins weather icons.
If you insist on doing this, you will have to find a way to automate mouse clicks from Jenkins.
I have seen some projects have automated tests on forms, using Jenkins slave, autoit and vbscripts.
I 'm trying out the new declarative way of Jenkins, to do the simple task of deploying my app through /code/, I have a shell script /code/ which do basic things /code/ or /code/ and deploy using /code/, on my laptop I can run it as this /code/.
The best solution to this problem is to create a node in Jenkins .
Step 1 − Go to the Manage Jenkins section and scroll down to the section of Manage Nodes.
You need to change the ownership of your folder and give the folder to Jenkins group and user.
Jenkins is using the /url/ plugin and the scanning is done on the Jenkins container.
I really would n't recommend it, but there 's a way via Jenkins Remote API -  /url/ .
Then you could store this user on jenkins, but this does n't seem to be an optimal or even good solution.
Is there a good way to access npm git-depencies from jenkins without requiring extra steps that need to be done by each developer?
On the other Hand I cant add my gitea Server in the Jenkins web UI.
I need to make integration tests using xUnit for a Service that I made mainly making REST calls to a Jenkins host.
You can install one instance of Jenkins in a dedicated server, tune it, secure it and create the Jobs.
After it you can share the IP/Host and the user &amp; password to your colleagues and they can access to Jenkins.
I did setup jenkins with LDAP and i 'm able to login.
But when i stop the LDAP server I 'm unable to login to jenkins using jenkin 's local user account.
So I created a first user on the Mac mini, and used that user to install Jenkins on the machine.
Jenkins then created another user (Jenkins) on the Mac Mini.
I thought that correct way to proceed is to login as that Jenkins user (with Admin rights) and prepare the build environment as this Jenkins user.
But as I said the Jenkins user is Admin user.
And if it is supposed to be the first user I created (after booting the Mac mini for the 1st time), how do I let Jenkins use the apps then?
Any help appreciated, all the guides about jenkins speak of jenkins user, but none gave me an idea what is the best way to set this all up.
The above jenkins script is not created by me , but you can say its auto-generated and not available to view when i go to the location.
Other build related tools like Java, Maven etc, I always make sure that Jenkins can access them and execute them.
Setup build tools which are to be used/accessed from Jenkins, set them up with your 'first user' and give execute privilege to Jenkins user/group.
Jenkins internal user database is automatically disabled when you activate LDAP authentication.
I am working on a Jenkins job which accepts some parameters from the user.
/pre/  However, for a more reduced test case I created a new Jenkins installation from the /code/ Docker image, configured it without any plugins (even the defaults), and created an equivalent job using the web UI.
/pre/  When the order of fields can change, you might want to ask for /code/ in Jenkins or try /code/.
So, I created a Credential, in jenkins, to store the password.
Im trying to use Jenkins Trigger builds remotely.
This is also considering that I plan to upload this to TFS so that I can have my tests launched from there (similar to what I did in Jenkins).
I have a situation where I am needing to trigger a jenkins job based on one or many computer hostnames.
I want the Jenkins job to run once for each hostname, and I want the user to be able to type in each hostname at the "Build With Parameters" run screen.
What options does Jenkins offer that allows me to have more than 1 String Parameter input by the user?
I 've already tried using docker login, but jenkins does n't allow it.
Now I 'd like to take this idea one step further and integrate this into our Jenkins build pipeline.
We use a lot of 3rd party images [Eg: gitlab , jenkins, centos7 ..] which we run inside our docker containers.
I am trying to implement Jenkins for our test project.
You can keep ID field empty - Jenkins will generate UUID in place, so when you add it, go to Edit view of the credentials so you can copy credentials ID.
Now you can use this username and password in Jenkins jobs located in the folder.
/pre/  /etc/default/jenkins .
It is located in Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security > Agents.
Why Jenkins generates simple quotes ?
I am doing a jenkins migration using jenkins-cli where in one step I am using sed command to replacing values manually as like below : .
And my own token cannot be used by the Jenkins Plugin, since it ONLY wants the integration token of the Jenkins CI app.
So this is forcing me to use 2 Jenkins CI apps: One from /url/ to work with the Jenkins Slack Plugin, and my own custom app just to get the token to use in jenkins scripts.
Is there a way to simply use a single Jenkins Slack app for both the Jenkins Plugin AND random scripts?
(The builtin Jenkins view is useless because it does n't show a subtree).
You will get an alert popup, enter the teamname::member , click ok ( note -this groups are created automatically in Jenkins by plugin w.r.t to bitbucket team structure ) .
I want to set up Jenkins for further testing, but I seem stuck.
I need to automate it so I can use it on Jenkins.
You can manage your roles using "role cookbooks" and then manage the role attributes using the recipe therein from jenkins.
while going inside the container using exec and switching to "jenkins" user i am able to run "docker".
Better option is to migrate(LDAP user) to Jenkins own user database.
Is the tool run as the jenkins user and is trying to access the home dir of build-user?
SO i 'm very new to jenkins and I 'm trying to use jenkins to automatically build my docker image.
Besides, an appropriate IAM role is attached to the ec2 instance on which jenkins is running and the instance metadata is accessible to jenkins user.
If there is a way extract and attach them as images (not the image link) with Jenkins pipeline email-ext commands please let me know.
If we don’t login to VM since a while and if some services (like Jenkins, etc.)
We cannot use a Windows machine as a jenkins slave because of a  team policy.
I have tried exposing the Docker URI and also tried adding jenkins user to Docker group.
I need a solution to get a TEST CONNECTION success when i enter 127.0.0.1:2375 in the Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> Docker builder section...
I am trying to build docker Image using jenkins x and I have created kubernetes cluster using minikube.
NB: I do not want to use jenkins 's build number.
So you can use Jenkins "as-is" or use with Tomcat.
What Ive done in a previous role -  is a copy of Jenkins config that allows admin &amp; a selection of other users access when LDAP is down.
We also have hooks to build via Jenkins etc.
I want to run it through Jenkins and do n't want to create my system as Jenkins slave, so does anybody having exp.
so I would go for Jenkins GUI polling configuration.
You 've added the docker group to the Jenkins user inside the container.
My preferred solution is to start an entrypoint as root, fix the docker group inside the container to match the gid of the mounted docker socket, and then switch to the Jenkins user to launch the app.
Or other solutions for making HA environment using Jenkins is really good.
You can also try to add SSH key to your jenkins credentials and then use the SSH link of your git repo instead of the https you currently use (assuming your SSH keys are deployed in git).
If that works, you should be able to also get it working in jenkins UI.
You need to install docker client inside a Jenkins container.
/pre/  The jenkins server is using the /url/ and that is how i have been trying to access the revision number previously.
/pre/  This way the user in the container still uses the jenkins user id + group id to avoid permissions conflicts with shared data but is also member of the docker group inside container which is required to access the docker socket (/var/run/docker.sock) .
How can achieve the same using Jenkins?
I want to create a credential (to access my GitHub) that can be only used by me in Jenkins.
available in Jenkins workspace , then I use this common downstream job to pick a given rpm that I need by using /code/ regex.
I 'm trying to generate log files using some_method() and write it into mapped network location (output_directory) via Jenkins windows agent.
First of all, you need to understand that your Jenkins tool and /code/ user are two different concepts.
That 's why if you need to use system Maven, you need to add Maven configuration in Manage Jenkins -> Global Tool Configuration page, then uncheck /code/ checkbox and enter /code/ and /code/: /url/ This will allow Jenkins to know path of your system Maven tool (as Evgeni Enchev already said in comments, after that Jenkins will know where /code/ is).
How to force the jenkins pipeline to select only slaves available agent that are windows slaves nodes ?
We tried to add /code/to the Jenkins scipt and to Global MAVEN_OPTS.
I want show the result in Jenkins.
My jenkins is connected to our AD using the ad plugin.
So logging in Jenkins with the service account I have all the permissions I want/need and I can run a build just fine.
I 'm trying to apply a jenkins build and I need to resolve the 'Basic Authentication' Error .
I 'm not familiar with Jenkins but have you tried using /code/ or /code/?
Of course, you will need to somehow save the value on the Jenkins side to reuse it.
Previously it could be possible to use /code/, but now it is identical to /code/ for builds created in 1.597+ Jenkins.
You need to configure Git tool in the Manage Jenkins -> Manage Nodes -> YOUR_NODE_NAME -> Configure page.
* Node list retrieval is being performed using Jenkins API, so it will require script approvals in the Sandbox mode To see this example from jenkins.io please visit : /url/ .
Jenkins will use its private key associated with the job to read the remote repo.
But: the script executed within the job itself will use the default SSH key found in the user running Jenkins itself: ~user/.ssh/id_rsa .
Make sure the default private key is the one you need for that job (or you can set one through /code/): the point being, this is no longer related to the Jenkins SSH Credential plugin.
We plan to use this user to configure Jenkins for our team.
/pre/  So I 'd want Jenkins to: .
I am trying to setup a container in OpenShift that runs a Jenkins that is itsself able to run docker to make use of declarative pipelines where the build is running in it 's own docker container.
Unfortunately there is no check box "Accept untrusted SSL certificates" (like on Jenkins endpoint).
I already have a private key(in OpenSSH format starts with /code/) that works perfectly from shell under jenkins user but when I use it from web interface it throws /code/ .
/pre/  So /url/ is an article using another approach to build docker containers with Jenkins inside a docker container: .
How to check if user is already created in Jenkins on Groovy?
Consequently I lose my other manually created users in Jenkins GUI.
We had the similar issue, though our settings were all correct as we were getting the user search results by setting up the similar LDAP configuration on different tools like Jenkins, SonarQube; etc.
I 'm curious if anyone has figured out how to run expo CI/CD inside of a docker container using Jenkins as the main way of facilitating that.
I want to send email after post build action in jenkins.
The only way that I want to do so, is just by using a pipeline written in Groovy so to integrate with Jenkins.
My jenkins instance which is on an EC2 is utilizing the user 's API token to authenticate the POST command from slack.
Things I have tried:  - Opening up the security groups   - In jenkins selecting “Allow anonymous read access”   - In Jenkins deselecting “Prevent Cross Site Request    Forgery exploits” .
The values in choice list is based on user who logs in jenkins.
I want to use parameter in one field in Jenkins like this: .
How Jenkins is able to ensure this robustness?
If Jenkins does n't need to be up and running 24/7, then how does it watch for any changes?
If you want just publish your test results in Jenkins, use /url/.
I 'm trying to configure container inside jenkins file so that my laravel application should run inside container during testing.
I want to use CI with GitHub for Jenkins job.
This is all taken care of and built using Jenkins and is working great.
If Jenkins does n't need to be up and running 24/7, then how does it watch for any changes?
Jenkins and other automation servers offer two options to watch source code changes:  .
I currently tried to use phantomJS on the jenkins server.
I tried, to select push events and accepted MR events on jenkins side, it works but for each push !
I am not able to access the Jenkins x dashboard.
I am able to get normal static analysis from Sonarqube integrated with Jenkins but when I try to get the PR analysis in Git I am not able to get it.
I 'm currently trying to setup a new CI/CD system based on Ubuntu 14.04 using Jenkins and Mecurial as my SCM.
I am running SonarQube in a Jenkins pipeline (not using the plugin, I am using a container).
You could set environment variables in Jenkins and access them like this .
One way to make it work is to have the agent workspace shared from the host, in your case using /jenkins/workspace as a volume in the agent so the data written by the agent is actually written in the host and then can be shared to the new container.
With this approach you do n't need Jenkins :b .
I want to trigger my Nightwatch tests to run via Jenkins, although I am not exactly sure how to do that.
Also is there any way to launch the web browser via Jenkins?
So we will need to add the current user to jenkins for it to work.
So we highly recommend using one of the public clouds above to try out Jenkins X.
I have a hosted Jenkins server and from there, I am trying to fetch the build details (like result, timestamp, duration etc.)
for all the jobs using the Jenkins REST API and then save it in my database.
I 'm a long-time Jenkins user in the middle of evaluating Buildbot and would like to offer a few items for folks considering using Buildbot for multi-module solutions: .
The Jenkins Job Builder application is very handy for this purpose and it 's what we use.
So I made same jobs by using scp and sync all of /var/lib/jenkins/jobs of two masters.
Then, is there no methods that make Jenkins HA?
Please help me how would I achieve it and show the drop down list of resources dynamically in my jenkins job.
You can find the initial password here /Users/{username}/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword .
I want to store credentials in Jenkins and for each deploy job select credentials set from dropdown which will be passed (just password ) to powershell script.
1.Double tap on finder select "Go to folder"  enter /Users/Shared/Jenkins/Home .
Using /url/ Jenkins has to periodically check SCM for the changes.
If you use Jenkins pipeline script instead of Jenkins UI then your /code/ should contain proper /url/ directive (corresponding to the above screen): .
   I am trying to setup a container in OpenShift that runs a Jenkins that is itsself able to run docker to make use of declarative pipelines where the build is running in it 's own docker container.
This can either be the one in which Jenkins is running (if you use the Jenkins image provided by OpenShift, this gets added by default at least), or an external cluster.
Jenkins will create a container based on the image received as parameter and then excute commands inside this container.
Jenkins is build to interact with a SCM, doing all the things locally seems to make nonsense or is not the Jenkins way of thinking.
In my situation, I was using a keychain (as @coffeebreaks suggested) which was being setup when I sourced in the jenkins user .bashrc file.
These expansions are performed unconditionally, so there 's no way to disable it without modifying or replacing several classes in Jenkins.
So, I need store SSH key into Jenkins container before /code/.
I also faced this issue while integrating with jenkins server, I was used the root user for jenkin job, the issue was fixed when I changed the user to other user.
I could n't prevent Jenkins to create a different pipeline to each stage, so my solution was: .
You are also using single quotes for both Jenkins and in the command you 're running.
I 'm trying to work on a plugin for Jenkins that requires access to the logged in user.
It appears that when i 'm running the /code/, the Jenkins server that is spun up appears to have a user called 'Anonymous' without the option to login/logout etc.
Is there any way to enable user authentication on this spun up Jenkins Server?
You can use /url/ or /url/ to create a zip archive in Jenkins job.
You can use the Flexible Publish from Jenkins.
You can change the executor 's settings or add more jenkins slaves to your jenkins setup if you need to scale the number of jobs you can run.
I am new to Jenkins and I successfully created few jobs and agent is active and all is good, But now I want to send a mail to my boss weekly with reports of the jobs like pass percentage or reports graph.
If nothing works simply create another user in tomcat-users.xml file with magnager-script role assigned and set this user credential to jenkins .
In my case the problem was that inside the container I was user jenkins instead of root.
If you have already created Jenkins credentials like these: /url/ then you will be available to run your job using Build with Parameters button and select needed credentials: /url/ .
Problem is that jenkins is running a specific user inside the container.
So for our jenkins setup, it starts containers via  .
Created a simple custom Jenkins plugin.
I would say rather use GIT Web-hooks to implement your case, as in web-hooks it will trigger the branch in which you will do any changes (in Jenkins create a multi-branch pipeline, so that it will create a job for each of your branches) .
By default Jenkins X creates build pods which have tools like /code/, /code/ or /code/ inside - so you need to run those binary tools inside /code/ block which is what the default pipelines do.
Now I want to display the value of NODE_NAME on view of jenkins UI in the red circle below.
I 'm trying to use C# to trigger a remote Jenkins job which has parameters.
And specficially, I am using that to provision Jenkins images with the operating system that the developers like to have as a basis.
I am able to build an docker image using jenkins x but how can I deploy that image on kubernets.
/pre/  and in the results you need to search for Jenkins and ExposedPorts, and looks similar to this: .
After check your ports if you want/need to change it in Jenkins you have two options: .
In your case most suitable way to achieve your goal is making your jenkins job periodically.
You can pass variables via the environment, I use this method with Jenkins.
However, I was not able to add jenkins to the group docker using usermod with the mentioned solutions.
usermod: user 'jenkins' does not exist .
When you execute your Robot Framework test cases using Jenkins, then you need to know your Jenkins setup.
A more advanced setup will likely execute the jobs on separate machines using Jenkins Agents.
An specficially, I am using that to provision Jenkins images with the operating system that the developers like to have as a basis.
Using Jenkins plugin /url/, is there a way to identify in the triggered job the triggering job?
Does Jenkins provide any credential management feature where you are not dependent on mercy of your Jenkins admin for secrecy of your password?
Applying: first commit Applying: Create jenkins-git-build.sh Using index info to reconstruct a base tree... .
/pre/  It does n't take much to figure out that Jenkins is choosing the 32bit Binaries to connect when it is meant to choose 64 bit: .
My current solution was to create a Jenkins slave on the master with label 'PIPELINE', configure it to only run jobs with that label, then use that label with the top level agent in the pipeline.
We want to use an AMI image which were created and uploaded by a Jenkins job using the AWS CLI, and not managed by Terraform.
I am a beginner user of Jenkins.
I do n't know if that 's always the case, or if our Jenkins box has been specifically setup that way.
I 've got a Jenkins pipeline with multiple stages, that will need to know how the build was triggered (by user, timer, etc.)
Jenkins triggers the container via .
But Jenkins is using only one executor to run both stages... it 's also important that they use the same workspace.
I have tried using logstash-jenkins plugin , but I am not able to use grok in the plugin.
/pre/  I 'm sure the user of Jenkins is root, as shown below from inside the container: .
/pre/  What am I missing to make Docker-Compose work from inside a Dockerized Jenkins container?
Using different pipelines for Jenkins I 'd like to switch between them.
I want to use /url/ This is an example syntax for Jenkins scripted piepline: .
On the other hand, using /code/ is not the recommended way of initializing objects in the Jenkins Pipeline.
1) Login to an existing Jenkins and create a new credential of kind "Username and password" .
Enter into URL textbox job_url from Jenkins /code/, select /code/ and press /code/ .
But the issue is, always Jenkins is trying to search the PR in a different location, i.e.
Usually for the complex deployment process companies are using "Master+Agent" scheme, but in your case there is no need to create some advanced Jenkins system with master and agents if you can build it on one host and you have not any additional projects or restrictions.
I am also able to clone Jenkins pipeline from a specific branch.
The username and password for the website is the same username and password I use for Jenkins.
I want to get the Jenkins username and password and and pass it to the java code i have written to login to the website.
How do I get the Jenkins Username and Password properties?
Background: Lets say I use "username1" and "password1" to login to Jenkins.
I want to write the Java code in such a way that when each person login to the system and run this jenkin job, it will get the username and password that this person logged into jenkins and use that username and password to login to the website.
Below is the script that you can use if you have not enabled the /url/ in Jenkins.

I am trying to get the commitID/revision in changeSet in Jenkins.
If you are open to additional tools, you can trigger the cloudformation stack via a Jenkins job and allow only the admins to trigger that job.
If you want to trigger a /url/ in Jenkins you can also make use of an api in combination with a parameterized build: .
Go to Manage Jenkins > Configure System screen, then check Enable security and choose Role-Based Strategy in Authorization section:/url/ .
Then you will be available to define and assign roles by using the Manages Roles item which appears in the Manage Jenkins screen.

/pre/  The Jenkins user is the user logged on that machine (Win Server 2012 r2) and has all Jenkins rights.
But as per my requirement I need to login through the application with generic credentials to integrate with Jenkins.
When I go to enter, jenkins ask me about a password to unlock.
I would like to manage my users in Jenkins with admin.I m planning to do it by Role based strategy in configure global setting option.
or you can use the jenkins rest api directly  /url/ .
Create new creadentials in Jenkins.
How users authenticate towards Jenkins is configured in the "Global Security->Security Realm" section.
If you configure, for example, LDAP-based authentication, then Jenkins will not store the entered credentials at all (for good reason).
Only in the very special case where you select "Jenkins’ own user database" as Security Realm, you might be able to retrieve the password.
Possibly, delegating Jenkins authentication to a servlet container can help -- if you manage to connect the servlet container 's authentication machinery to the services that you need to use.
In the case you just want to test Jenkins and you do n't need a password use the JAVA_OPTS without running the setup like this: .
/pre/  If you are using the basic jenkins image you should n't have any password and have full access to your jenkins (Do n't live it like this if you are going to create production ready jobs) .
This can also be done if your stack is using aws (CLI) and (or) Jenkins .

I am starting to auditi my jenkins users.
How can I get the timestamp of user 's last login in Jenkins?
I use Jenkins ver.
For continuous delivery, my understanding is, two Jenkins pipe lines need to be created, as shown below:  .
Of course this is done usually by CI&amp;CD pipeline like Jenkins.
So I guess the only way to set a custom update site is to have a custom update site is to feed Jenkins with a custom /code/ at the start.
we are using Jenkins LTS 2.150.1, Is it possible to hide the nodes/slaves list (by default at the lower left side of the screen) from "regular" users (i.e - not admins).
Edit: At least if I use /code/ as suggest by the dynamically generate API, Jenkins will crash.
To get rid of this tight coupling, we can write code in such a way so that the Jenkins build environment can get information automatically about all the existing keys which presents currently in the Property file.
The Web says that this will happen, if you are trying to execute that command with an user that is not registered to Jenkins, also called unknown user :) .
So which command Jenkins uses to get this list (I am using git for repository version control).
Master needs to maintain a workspace in order for it to load the jenkins file, determine the node to use and serialize commands back and forth.

Still in Jenkins' web interface, go to your build job and define that you want to trigger a build using a script (this is going to be the SVN commit hook in the next step): .
Because I am basically trying to export a complicated structure from Jenkins I do n't have the luxury knowing what field I can exclude (in fact, I am trying to determine what fields are available).
Or you can just create a Jenkins Server with the image that Azure provided, see /url/.
Which is great for people who are n't allowed to make changes to the jenkins file as they skip the initial clone and checkout.
I have a Jenkins Pipeline project and want to send out an email.
I did set up the SMTP settings for Jenkins (Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> E-mail Notification) and could successfully send a test mail by using the "Test Settings" button.

So far we 've been using Selenium grid with Docker and Jenkins but only for Firefox and Chrome.
I want to use Docker because it keeps all the Jenkins slaves clean and allows for controlled versions of browsers, and we can control multiple containers with Docker-Compose.
In order to customize my instance, I have created a /code/ file in which I define my custom agent and my custom Jenkins X image for master using the properties /code/ and /code/ and this works well.
If your hosting Jenkins in AWS it 's also nice to just add an IAM role to the instance to control what API actions Jenkins is allowed to run and use a plugin like /url/ for your pipeline tasks.
there is n't much to tell about it; except that Android Studio &amp; Jenkins both need to act as Git clients.
Trying to automate login in jenkins as passsword expires after few days.

Does Jenkins have a feature like credentials that is for non-secret information?
My use case is that I want to specify some values in jenkins to make them easily available to all of my pipelines.
an Azure subscription id) I tried to just use  'secret text' type credentials, but the magic that jenkins does to protect those credentials make it difficult to work with them.
Additionally this template approach should easily fit into /url/ pipeline using Jenkins.
I am trying to run an existing emulator using Jenkins Android Emulator Plugin.
When Jenkins Pipeline to launch the agent container, it will change the container 's /code/ via /code/ option and mount the Jenkins job 's workspace folder via /code/ option.
We have to add our automation code to Jenkins pipeline there the server system machine will not have the access for the application so we have to bypass the authentication passing user id and passwords of test user.
This way your jenkins will authorize on GH automatically (assuming you 're pulling via https), and dev environments can get authorization interactively.
Jenkins use the user /code/.
So I can definitely have Jenkins send notifications to users through Jabber, by using the post-build actions for each project (that is good).
I am trying to retrieve specific jenkins details about last successful build, such as revision SHA1.
If this is a two different apps and there is no reasonable reason, would be better to separate job for each app in jenkins.
I have Kubernetes running on my Macintosh computer and I 'm trying to run a Jenkins image which has the ability to connect to the internal docker system and then spin up more docker images in order to be able to run jobs on them.

The Jenkins I 'm using cannot cope with nested nodes.
In /code/ you need to stop and start /code/ after you change jenkins 's user 's permissions.
We 're using /code/ to run Pylint under Jenkins using /code/.
This way we can have separate stages in Jenkins for each.
I 've added support for custom labels (my company 's CI infrastructure relies on Jenkins &amp; Gerrit, plus we could n't wait for this feature) .
This allows you to add custom labels from Gerrit Server configuration page and customize each reporting values for EACH job (Configure -> Gerrit Trigger -> Advanced) while taking care of the backstage inner workings of the plugin (communication between Gerrit &amp; Jenkins)  .

you 'll need to 'unload' Jenkins: .
You can create a simple /url/ which uses the Custom Connector that you created to trigger the Jenkins job .
Expose Jenkins For this you could simple just open a port on your VNET 's NSG but this really is n't recommended I guess, since you might as well just expose it on your on-premises network directly instead.
I would like to add test report in form of .html file on the Jenkins so I thought about creating archive.
I 'm not entirely sure what the reason for that is in those tutorials, however, I can suggest an easy way to get started with Jenkins for free (That 's how I usually run jenkins for personal use).
You can create a free account with one of the Cloud providers like AWS, GCP or Azure and have your jenkins running there.
This properties file is read by the Jenkins Extended Choice Parameters plugin to display check boxes for a user to select which applications to build.

However, in order to use the plugin, it is necessary to activate it through the Jenkins UI by clicking 'Manage Jenkins, then Configure System and selecting a role-based strategy.
1st of all I turned off security in config.xml and could use jenkins as Anonymous User.
If your jenkins user is already in that file, then modify to look like this: .
I am using jenkins file for this purpose.
BTW this is exactly what CI systems like (Jenkins, TeamCity etc.)
Additionally, Jenkins is behind a corporate proxy that requires authentication.
Either changing something in my Jenkins pipeline or using a completely different approach would do.
I do have full control of the Jenkins install and can make any changes I need to it.
To keep things simple I am ignoring the Jenkins part for now and I 've cut my Dockerfile back to to a minimum which I build using: .

Try building this manually first and then integrate with jenkins.
I would like to add a way to tag my docker images generated by the jenkins build step.
It would be better if you use the dockerfile(s) with jenkins in order to build your images and keep docker-compose.yml file(s) for deploying the application itself without using the build keyword .
I am unable to hide the execution of an sh step on my jenkins pipeline on the Blue Ocean view, my /code/ looks like this: .
Jenkins Solution: Create user for John in jenkins console.
Jenkins solution: Create a new job based on origin job, using the copy from option.
Best solution for "jenkins in docker container needs docker" case is to add your host as a node(slave) in jenkins.
My Jenkins pipeline contains calling another build job like this: .
Then when you want to ship your application you can start this Jenkins-job.
/pre/  Then to start that specific service in jenkins we use the command .

I need to integrate with an unmaintained Jenkins server, and call a job with parameters on it using the API .
Anyone using Jenkins, might get it useful .
I use open-source applications, so Jenkins sounds like a "must use".
However, it is possible to approximate in a few ways (though the Jenkins user database still wo n't be usable).
In addition, /code/ will show that the Jenkins process is being run by the /code/ user.
If I have a single repository, and I keep developing new microservices, do I need to have separate jenkins file per microservices or can I have a jenkinsfile in the parent project and use docker-compose?
Or do I need to look at Jenkins X ?
Jenkins is not able to use the git binary .
There 's no url for it from what I can tell and even if it were I would still like to know the nuances in play of using awk in Jenkins.
is there a way that ansible can handle situations like this to receive results and act on them or is this something that a tool like jenkins would be needed  .
I am using Jenkins and it rocks!
It should be something on the Jenkins management level, but we did n't find the way to do so.
I would like to save the build file (/code/ and /code/ file) with a unique name (like /code/ + /code/), build number should be reset every day with current date based on Jenkins job 's ID.
Switch to your Jenkin Account [Login to your Jenkins Account] .
Set permissions to Jenkins user on the SSH key.
It should be the master private key you should have in your jenkins credentials and use that to connect to your slave.
If you do n't want to put your own CI/CD system (like Jenkins) and a /url/ listening to /url/... you can use /url/, by /url/.

If you want to create your own CICD structure, there are tools like Jenkins.
While running a pipeline script in Jenkins ,i noticed the job run in the "Jenkins user" perspective and not by the logged in user .
Is there a way that script can be executed by logged in user on the server instead of the jenkins system user.
jenkins in the EC2 instance without sudo privilege, or at least passcode protected sudo  And it 's a good scenario that using Ansible to manage those users accounts, it limits usage of the super key created by AWS .
We are using Jenkins to make theese deplosy to stage, maybe it can help me.
how do I allow access to docker in the jenkins container?
How can I make Jenkins mask these password fields?
Note that when I add a new credential using the Jenkins console, the newly added credential and all the previously populated credentials (using Ansible) in the credentials.xml, get masked.
Now only Jenkins needs to know the list of emails address for the deployment results, you can use /url/ as @Avneesh Srivastava mentioned  .
And I use jenkins for autobuild.

/pre/  I want to use /code/on the shell, A.K.A on the host machine terminal but I do n't know how to proceed, my attempt was to use /code/ but obviously it needs authentication which I think that it is not possible on jenkins, can you point me to the right direction?
I want to trigger jenkins build if a new tag is pushed to a remote repository.
But i want the jenkins job to run in case I want to release already committed code for another feature with a new tag name.
If you happen to be the admin of this Jenkins instance, then login to the instance and go to System information under manage Jenkins.
By the way, you should run this on the machine directly not via Jenkins.
Hence, I have created a enivironment variable in Jenkins configuration page and used in the field as follows.
As one of solutions: you can run Jenkins agent (service) under account, which have administrative permissions.
If you do n't have jenkins, you may try pure cloud solution provide by GCP /url/ .
I need to automate the build status in Jenkins by generating the excel sheet out of the result.
İf you want to use jenkins variable, you have to use "%" symbol.
We have planned to do it using different approaches but if jenkins already can do it as part of the workflow using any pluggin.
The script creates a dummy user (as I did using the console) at the Jenkins startup which, consequently, masks all the pre-populated credentials.
I use Jenkins and ran into this problem when trying to perform a release (which requires a git commit).

If you 're running on Windows OS, you can check Environment Variables (Control Panel >> System and Security >> System >> Advanced system settings >> Advanced tab, press "Environment Variables..." and check for JENKINS_HOME in the "System variables" section).
The credentials for Perforce is now in Jenkins but could be created in runtime or something like that if it is possible what I want to do.
Example: Imagine I have two credentials stored in my Jenkins (perforce1 and perforce2).
Now I want to scan this API with a Jenkins build job.
I have a Jenkins setup where there are a number of slaves, the slaves represent test systems consisting of various pieces of hardware.
I can disable a stand which works in some cases, ie where the user does n't want to run any jobs through Jenkins, but even in that case you still ca n't tell who has disabled it or why from the main page, you have to go into the slave 's page.
I 'm pretty new to Jenkins and trying to run or be able to run multiple jenkins jobs in parallel with different goals (inside my goals will have a mvn command, also cucumber @tags).
the Jenkins Service is also configured with a Domain User Account as a Service Logon Account.
I can logon to the win 10 box as the (Jenkins) domain user, and open a cmd window and run the following with no problem at all .
but if you try to "Build" the solution via Jenkins Web UI, it has a problem during the Nunit test finding some elements after it does a few clicks and a submit.
I know the IE configuration is rock solid like I said the test runs fine in a command window when logged in as the (Jenkins) Domain account .

Jenkins uses a TCP port to communicate with agents launched via the JNLP protocol, such as Windows-based agents.
The downside to randomized JNLP ports is that they’re chosen during the boot of the Jenkins master, making it difficult to manage firewall rules allowing JNLP traffic.
Try an alternate Jenkins mirror for the resource, like: .
I used my public key instead of the private key when I created the SSH credentials on Jenkins Web... now it all works :) .

The Jenkins project is parameterized with "choice parameter" which gives list of available API 's to deploy and next there is "string parameter" where the user need to key in the version of the API which they wish to deploy.
For example: If the user chooses "Ticket API" from the available list of API 's, Jenkins project should go and check in the "JFrog Artifactory" and get the list of available versions of the "Ticket API" and display it to the user to choose the version which he/she wants to deploy.
Hi I am using a Jenkins pipeline file and i want to integrate the /url/ tool.
I intend on using to help me with CI/CD pipelines, which means my master node will need to catch git webhooks (with Spinnaker, much like Jenkins).
I do n't know how can run this type of script on Jenkins because the Jenkins is not actually launching the browser then how it will check the web element is present or not and how it will take the screenshot of the webpage.

I am trying to choose a different docker agent from a private container registry based on an a parameter in Jenkins pipeline.
The jenkins user is setup to use bash and is available in /etc/passwd .
I ca n't seem to /code/ to jenkins user even though the login shell is already set to /code/.
My /code/ shows this for jenkins: .
As you may know the image you are running only has the user /code/ created, so when jenkins pass its own uid and gid , there is no entry for the user and consequentially no /code/ declared for it.
if you notice the volume I am using with the flag /code/, as I am going to build with root, I need to tell docker that this volume will be shared among another containers, and then preventing access denied from my jenkins container (running with the user jenkins not root) .
/pre/  Set /code/ and /code/ through system property from jenkins.
Now create a separate role called "JenkinsRole"( whatever name suits you which will be used by the Jenkins node), that has an inline policy to pass "PackerRole".

This does n't leave you any room for connecting to external docker server unless you would make it a Jenkins node with some special label, like for example  'docker-special'.
The only way out for declarative would be to mark the external server as jenkins node with specific label.
I 'm trying to get some experience with Docker and Jenkins, and want to deploy a Spring boot server using both of these technologies.
The key is that every repository should call a JenkinsSharedLibrary, which gives you the possibility to maintain your jenkins builds in one central source, instead of having multiple "hardcoded" jenkinsfiles per repository.
This article describes the use case of a shared library and how to use Jenkins across multiple git repos.
How can I tell Jenkins to use specific credentials for this task (and how can I configure those credentials in Jenkins)?
In a Jenkins Pipeline we want to create a config File with variable content and so we use StreamingTemplateEngine.
/pre/  Perfect, we thought, so now we want to use this snippet in a Jenkins Pipeline, but Jenkins behaves somehow different using this test stage code: .

I 've given for the jenkins' user ability to interact with the desktop of my current user: .
so if I connect to my linux system through ssh using jenkins' user credentials, export display of my current user (export DISPLAY=:10) and run, for example google-chrome or firefox inside of putty 's terminal, they are launching on my current user 's desktop.
/pre/  It 's because of this script should work only when desktop is loaded to share my current user 's display with jenkins' user.
If you need this for Jenkins.
How does jenkins make these decisions?
Jenkins is creating a new workspace for  every build job (= run) per default.
Seems to be a million Jenkins plugins but I have n't quite found one to do what I want.
And I want to use Jenkins to deploy new container.
Benefits are: jenkins jobs do not need to be adapted (assuming they have SCM polling enabled), no special credentials and the jobs do not need to be known upfront.
I have to add inbuild variable to jenkins api (jenkinsurl/job/buildnumber/api/json) that behaviours like currentBuild.
Since you are using Jenkins, maybe you have some wrong settings there like missing dependencies or something like that.

Facing issue related to adding new users in Jenkins as I am not able to see Manager user options.
Jenkins is using ldap for authentication.
This might not be available in the Jenkins system.
The short answer is that you can use the /code/ API more effectively when trying to run in a build script/Jenkins environment.
If you have Jenkins impersonation enabled, then I believe the result should be equivalent, otherwise this will only get you the user who owns the jenkins agent on the build machine.
Upside: No need to install plugins (which on shared/large Jenkins instances can be tricky) .

please suggest is it possible to achieve through Jenkins?
How can I compare a list of apps between two namespaces using /code/ by jenkins pipeline?
Jenkins pipeline does n't support remote activation so you can do one of the following, create an "adapter" job which support remote activation via the UI ( not a pipeline ) and trigger it, which in turn will trigger your pipeline.
or use the /url/ if its in the same Jenkins.
if it 's a job on a remote Jenkins you can try "/url/" although i did n't use it personally.
Without rebuilding jenkins to use different security libraries is it possible to solve this issue ?

Is it possible to skip a /code/ step in a Jenkins pipeline from running if a certain property is already set?
Jenkins gives the numeric user ID and numeric group ID that the Agent should use.
So you need to tell Jenkins to run the Docker container with that sharing, thus: .
And you can not simply tell Jenkins to user user /code/ and group /code/ .
I have a Jenkins pipeline which is already started and prompting for human input (to select deploy target) at final stage.How can I make selection and proceed to next stage using Jenkins CLI installed on a remote machine ?
I like to get feedback on best practices on Automating Access Management to provide user access to Jenkins.
My thoughts here is to create a Jenkins job that an admin can execute that looks up a table of users and executes thereby giving each users the appropriate access rights.
I have a Jenkins Multibranch job, and I would like to filter the branches of multiple repositories by name.
See this image for example configuration in Jenkins UI, instead of /code/ I would like to write an identifier of my own choosing.
I 'm trying to create a custom Jenkins pipeline which will bind together artifacts generated by multiple Jenkins jobs.
I do n't like the approach in your way, but if you insist to do it via jenkins, you can write a wrapper to run the terraform depend on which files are changed.
You need to add create a shh key using ssh-key , add it to both jenkins credentials and the git repository you are trying to fetch the code from.
but on the Jenkins it 's not working I think the problem is with clicking on the login button and /code/.
the Jenkins is not able to send the Keys and click on the login button.
I am building a web application (as a Docker image) that I would like to test using Jenkins, before publishing to a registry.
First - In jenkins.co/configure check all the triggers for email ext plugin and fill in some emails in the default recipients input separated by a single space .
Is that possible in Jenkins?
This will disable all the security in the Jenkins and the login option would disappear .

I want to get the branch details from the Jenkins bash.
As an added bonus, if someone updates common, all projects running this script will automatically commit an external property update which can trigger CI (using something like Jenkins).
This will be done in a much easier way if you are using the scripted Jenkins pipeline.

I am trying to setup Jenkins inside docker on Windows 10 pro.
In Jenkins by default user authentication is not enabled but we can establish the user authentication from the Global Security section.
The users can login to Jenkins and perform their task.
It is the combination of your Jenkins landing page and a suffix string to validate you are a logged in user.
As we want to land user to Jenkins dashboard, so it has the same URI which we mentioned in the previous step and don’t forget to include /code/ at the end.
Immediately after saving changes Jenkins will allow access to all users in your domain.

Ok so based on my understanding you should add: -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=false to the MAVEN_OPTS if you click on Advanced button in the Build section of your Jenkins Job.
This is due to jenkins specifies this value to true per default.
I realize I could set the agent at the top, but according to Jenkins documentation, that is bad practice, as waiting for user input will block the execution.
If you are stucked on an installation using sandboxes and Jenkins Script Security plugin with no possibility to add whitelisted classes/methods, the only way I found is the following : .
I can manually add a new step to add the Jenkins Text Finder and make it work.
use esc-cli as an alternative incase if you do not want to use task definition , install esc-cli on jenkins node and run it, but that still need docker-compose on the git.
/pre/  Groovy sandbox mode (enabled by default for all Jenkins pipelines) ensures that every invocation passes script approval check.

How can I add "Discover tags" when creating a Multibranch Pipeline using the Jenkins Job DSL to achieve the same effect?
I 'm relatively new to Jenkins pipelines, but having implemented already a few, I 've realised I need to start using jenkins shared library before I go mad.
At the bottom of Jenkins UI I see: .
and on Jenkins side you also can manipulate of state of your build via simply try/catch statement: .
Already the jenkins job are predefined with set of some environment variables like BUILD_NUMBER,JOB_NAME etc.
We have a pipeline that needs to know the login identity of the Jenkins user when they run a number of related jobs.
Users are given access to Jenkins via the /url/.
In a further step, we want to use the Jenkins login for an app called by the Jenkins pipeline.
We can see the username top right of the Jenkins screen (and in the console log), so there is clearly a bullet-proof way to read the username that Jenkins itself uses.
Navigate to the credentials item in Jenkins UI you, click Inspect Element on the password field, and copy its /code/ attribute (something like /code/ .
You may need to add jenkins user to docker group.
In /url/, the default settings of this helm chart let Jenkins run as root user with uid 0.

How can i use saved Jenkins credentials for authentication?
If you are using Jenkins Multibranch Pipeline, you can obtain the branch name by using the following variable.
I was thinking I can create a Jenkins job running every 5 minutes that requests the dependencies thorugh a build using placeholders such as latest release and latest snaphost but i want to know if there is any easier and cleaner way to achieve this.
If you want to run a jenkins job on a remote machine you will need to set the jenkins slave service or any other option to configure the remote node.

As for Selenium Grid, the command that is used in the build step of Jenkins explicitly says NOT to use Selenium Grid.
/pre/  You do not need specify jenkins_url or job_name etc to get last successful build id.
/pre/  Then told Jenkins to mount that Docker Volume in a suitable location for each Agent, by having it give a /code/ option to its /code/ command.
The jenkins user inside the container can run any docker commands as we 've mapped the the /var/run/docker.sock from the host to inside the container, and I 've opened up the permissions to allow all users to execute all command without needing a password.
I am trying to do unit tests with Karma using PhantomJS in Jenkins.
But the password extracted is the password I used to login to the machine; not the one I use for logging into the Jenkins.
NOTE: While the command above should kill the process, you will probably want to roll/regenerate your SSH keys (on the Jenkins machine, BitBucket/GitHub etc., and any other machines that Jenkins had access to) and perhaps even spin up a new Jenkins instance (if you have that option).
I want to inject passwords in a safe way into a jenkins job.
In this jenkins job I want to use this password as a password to log in to an online service in order to test several aspects of that service.
I am trying to run a command in Jenkins using /code/.
Because it is the usual case that you want to access the contents of your workspace, Jenkins automatically mounts it as a volume into the container.

I using first time trying to publish a junit report in jenkins.
Not sure what are the things I need to show my report in jenkins.
Use the AD authentication plugin or LDAP for authentication and authorization instead of Jenkins own database.
This will save you(Jenkins Admin) the overhead of managing user account credentials.
A user can reset account through AD or LDAP and it will be reflected in Jenkins as well.
In case you want to stick to Jenkins own database please use the rest interface  to design a custom password reset page for end users.
I want to deploy the same using Looper similarly like Jenkins I believe.
If you are using sensitive data (username, password,...) you could use jenkins credentials: .
If they are not (as for example /code/) they need some special metadata so Jenkins would know that.
I am setting up Jenkins in GKE using stable helm chart(/url/) as discussed in /url/ .

Jenkins has its own SMC user and server auth user.
The question I have is: Is there a way to grant jenkins a way to interact with my file system or is there an alternative tool which will allow me to do this.
All the examples I could find are using the jenkins web UI or the pollscm option.
I need to run the Jenkins from cmd because of UI Selenium tests and I need to start the Jenkins as administrator.
According to one of the RP devs, there are APIs that can be used, but investigating them on our RP server does not give very clear instructions on what every API does or if it is what is required to get test data from Jenkins to RP.

Jenkins is running as my local user (visible in the /code/ tab, via user.name and user.home, which is correctly set to the directory holding the .ssh directory.
Jenkins run its build scripts using specified user 'jenkins'.
You might want to check if 'jenkins' user had installed requires dependencies to run /code/, for e.g /code/ ... .
Jenkins create /code/ but It should create the tag like this.
There are several ways to implement this but since this is a windows server you can follow steps on /url/  to install jenkins slave as service without javaws.
In Blue Ocean, "Jenkins" appears in the upper left in white text.
If you have Jenkins or other CI/CD tool available you can create a job there that would enable/disable particular EC2 instances.
For some reason Jenkins does not persist the build history even if I 'm using the Build Discarder in the declarative pipeline.
Is there any other method of persisting a number of builds in Jenkins, other than Build Discarder, or I 'm using it wrong?

If there is a simpler way such as a built in Jenkins action to save to target, is there a Jenkins admin that could tell me what that action is?
We are currently using jenkins and we want to use gitlab ci instead.
There is quite a few tools we are currently using in Jenkins and that I want to use in gitlab CI.
So the purpose was to trigger a build on a Jenkins job after making a push to Gitlab Repo, Simple right?
Go to Jenkins>Manage Jenkins>configuration go to the Gitlab section and make sure is like so: /url/ After setting up all this test your connection and make sure is successfull.
in Gitlab add a Jenkins user to your project (the one you 're trying to get the webhook triggered from).
If it still not working another helper you can use is to add a logger to Jenkins  go to  Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > System log .
OR, under Jenkins 2 (we are using 2.121.1 plus /url/ (aka windows-slaves:1.4), there is now an option to "Let Jenkins control this Windows slave as a Windows service", essentially in the same fashion as a Linux node.

Trying to add new system properties to Jenkins through its GUI through script console like : System.setProperty("hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP", "") and some other properties but they 're removed whenever I restart Jenkins.
Is there a way to save the properties and survive the restart of Jenkins or is there any other way other than script console to add those properties?
I have jenkins build which triggers a selenium test, the selenium test in turn creates a process of a c# application.
What I 'm trying to do: Trying to install Jenkins locally in minikube using helm.
I basically want it to run similarily like jenkins works.
You should not need to enable anonymous access.Your jenkins requires authentication.
I need to build a job using choice parameter in jenkins .
Jenkins still has an edge here though from the user perspective because of its built-in web interface.
It seems like Jenkins does n't have such feature yet.
You can programmatically set parameters of Jenkins job depending on the environment.
I 'm trying to use docker in my jenkins build to run tests in.
I figured out that jenkins is launching it as the /code/ user on the host which is where 988 is coming from.
I know there are many plugins for Jenkins, but this is not the way to make the comparison best way.
Moreover Jenkins and similar tooling provides standard ways to handle such deployments problems.
I create a Multibranch pipeline in Jenkins, in al branches I put a Jenkinsfile, this make a merge with master and push the result.
I have a build/deploy job on jenkins, and user can select multiple items to be deployed with multi select parameter.
Is there a way of triggering a selection event on jenkins multi select?
I have this nicely working line for a Jenkins slave (Windows based): .
/pre/  Now i want the functional equivalent for a Jenkins slave (Linux based).
To solve this we need to change the owner of /code/ to the jenkins user: .
I would also suggest you configure /url/ to have an additional layer of security and if you can restrict it to be only accessible from your Jenkins Slaves.
Go to your Windows slave configuration Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes .
I want to use the jenkins credential manager to store the Oauth2 token - instead of passing it directly via s script .
But not able use the same via Jenkins.
Hi I am trying to call restapi to post some request ...here I need to use multipart section can you please suggest how to build data..this I need to do through Jenkins http plugin.. .
And yes, you may need to abandon this approach of using ACI Jenkins agents and as a workaround (for now) should go with VM 's as Jenkins agents  or run the Jenkins jobs on Jenkins master itself so that local .m2 cache would survive one build to the next.
That way Jenkins can pass all the value1, value2, value3, value4 for your build as input.
I 'm trying to use a Jenkins Active Choice Reactive Parameter and using Groovy to run an aws kms cli command, but the value does n't seem to be returning.
Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security > Under Authorization > Select Project-base Matrix Authorization Strategy .
To add a Jenkins Server you need to go on your Jenkins configuration: /code/ > /code/ > /code/ or /url/ and add the Url and credentials to the host from where will import the jobs.
After setting a Jenkins server you will be able to use the Jenkins Import plugin going to option /code/ in the Jenkins home or going to the URL: /url/ .
Normally you do n't need to set the Remote folder or Search into folders options, so if you use the default Jenkins settings, leave these fields blank.
I use this Plugin to trigger more jobs in Jenkins and it works as expected.

I am trying to use s3upload from Jenkins CI, I have added IAM user S3_User credentials in Jenkins console and using withAWS(region: s3Region ,credentials: s3User).
Provided S3_User access and secret key in Jenkins IAM credentials and added S3_UserRoleWithRWpolicy in IAM Role to use under IAM Role Support.
I am using the jenkins to run my automation scripts and attaching the extent report in email.
To make jenkins available on all interfaces, use following command.
/pre/   Yes, you have to provide the /code/ file, and create a new jenkins image containing all the required plugins.
After that you can use this new image instead of jenkins/jenkins:lts.
In Jenkins 2.46.3 I 'm trying to get the cause of the build (ie whether it was started by a git trigger or a human clicking "build now").
I am currently using the /url/ for Jenkins.
I am using the Swarm Plugins /url/ to connect my Windows Clients to Jenkins.
for example, if one of the Jenkins parameter is "A", I would like to add this logic: .

I am using jenkins extended choice parameter.
Now I need to run the OWASP zap zed using Jenkins or using selenium.
Unfortunately there is not a way to manually specify the servers programmatically using the "Publish Over SSH Plugin" as it only uses the servers that have been already been configured in the global configuration of your Jenkins instance.
On the Jenkins side, jenkins job --> build triggers --> "Poll SCM" and input how mins you want jenkins to scan the repo for any push events.
You can login to your artifactory docker hub remote in the same way in Jenkins, probably by using the /url/ - assuming you have Jenkinsfiles .
I am trying to build containers using a Jenkins shared-library that calls Kaniko.
Now it has become a standard CI / Jenkins situation.
When I open jenkins job page the filter should show branch which is defined by that variable, like this .
On Jenkins (fill in the following) Kubernetes URL = [put the server in here] Kubernetes server certificate key = [put cert in here] Credential, click Add, create a username/password credential, use access key as username and secret key as password.
All you have to do is add the users and and assign the manager-gui (for GUI access) and manager-script (for access like Jenkins deployment ).
All you have to do is add the users and and assign the manager-gui (for GUI access) and manager-script (for access like Jenkins deployment ).

If you want to return to Jenkins simple click 'Return'.
I am able to create the Jenkins service but I can not find ways to configure it using the command line.
Now i want to schedule this script to run in a timely fashion and wanted to use jenkins for the same.
Jenkins provides the upstream trigger for that and I would like to use variable to prevent hardcoded the name of the branch in the parameter Here is what I would like to do :  .
The Jenkins build will be kicked off by either human or a timer that is set in RTC.
Using Jenkins, you can fill these variables with Jenkins generated content, using e.g.
Is there a way to enter a Jenkins spawned container so I can try and duplicate what I 'm expecting vs what I 'm experiencing?
how can I restrict certain Jenkins users from deploying to certain environments in my Pipeline?
Have you set up your /code/ in Jenkins?
According to your question : "I want to deploy on the same server that my jenkins is running (Windows Server/IIS)" .. and comments I will suggest some approaches.
Basic deploy on IIS using Jenkins .
Advanced deploy on IIS using Jenkins .
This is the Jenkins chart if you want to check: /url/ .
I found that I do n't have to take any special measures in code if I ensure that the docker image is properly configured for the jenkins user.
The code I use to setup the image for the jenkins user for Debian/Ubuntu based images is: .
Another solution would be to run Jenkins as Docker container, so you can share the Jenkins home/workspaces easily with the containers you run within your build jobs, like described here: .
Whats the appropriate way to add the jenkins user to that file?
I am trying to password a password binding from jenkins to a powershell command line it works for passwords without special characters.
I read it should be a ` but i am unsure how to introduce that using the jenkins $env:USER_PASSWORD .
I have tried there are multiple curl and wget commands which accept username and password , But I need something without username and password as script runs on jenkins workspace we dont need to pass the password .
I am looking to create a Jenkins job using groovy script.
I wonder what is the best practice way to store password parameters in Jenkins?

Create a new set of username-password credentials in Jenkins where username and passwords are the ones that you use to connect to nexus.
I had to open up the security group for my RDS on AWS to accept inbound form Jenkins server.
What image are you using for Jenkins slave?
Does it have user jenkins?
You cannot run default Jenkins image in Openshift, because Openshift runs containers as random user.
If you do n't have this template and do n't have Jenkins image stream - you can try to use image /code/.
I have jenkins integrated with AD but it should work for other types of groups as well: .
This  All these activities can be automated by CI tools like Jenkins.
(i mean Jenkins validates input even before trying to pull the code.
But I do n't think you can use this feature if you are running Jenkins itself in docker.
you need to setup Jenkins on the host directly in that case.
The best way is to store them as Jenkins Credentials and inject them into your build via CredentialsBinding Plugin, whereby you can define how to make them available via the environment (Username:Password, Separated Username and Password,...).
Jenkins supports different types of credentials such as  .
as i forgot the userid/pwd of the jenkins, hence was not able to login.
now i found the uid/pwd and want to enable the uid/pwd security so that jenkins should ask uid/pwd for login.
I 'm trying to implement docker with jenkins and am not sure if I am on the right track.
This allows me to view and access the Jenkins content.
(1) Do I have to create a new container with a new name every time I want to install new jenkins plugins through the Dockerfile?
To reiterate, the fix was to use the Jenkins GUI to set up a new set of ssh credentials with a new private key generated as described by /url/ and add that private key to Jenkins, making sure to change the default username of "jenkins" to "git".
I need a Jenkins Build pipeline that gets triggered if there is a change to any of the modules.
If you want to interact with Jenkins via scripts there are two ways: .
This should be the way when you want to gather stuff from outside of Jenkins.
If Jenkins is secured then I think you will have to provide credentials when using the Jenkins CLI.
Clicking the "Use global Veracode user credentials" check box, omits these params and uses the global params specified under manage jenkins.
I am trying to setup Jenkins (for the first time) on a mac.

Alternatively, see if Jenkins can access them via /code/.
I have tried adding an NFS volume via the "Manage Jenkins -> "Configure System" in the jenkins UI.
In order to use your Jenkins host /code/ engine.
/pre/  PS - You can use /code/ in the stage whenever you want to use the Jenkins host machine.
You can use the /url/ to transform your Jenkins environment into a Selenium Grid.
If you do that you need to initialize your /url/s with the Jenkins master as the hub.
Once you log in Jenkins as admin, Manage Jenkins > Configure Global Security and select the "Enable Security" check box.
select "Jenkins Own User Database" for the security realm under access control  and then select "Logged in Users can do anything" under Authorization and Save it.
click on Manage jenkins>>Manage User >> Create User Complete the details.
So, there is a Jenkins user on the master box.
and Jenkins cannot ssh to these nodes there is another user builduser that can ssh to all the nodes but that one does n't appear to be used.
 You need install heroku as user under which jenkins is running.

If that 's the case, you can just derive the next release version from those tags, without having to store the version anywhere else (just make sure Jenkins is fetching tags in advanced clone behaviours).
/pre/  But ca n't use it from jenkins so need some other solution.
Then you would need webhooks (both bitbucket and github have them) and those hooks would inform your jenkins about the push events ( or any other event you want.
Jenkins/Gerrit have not a way to handle specifically this but I 'll suggest some workarounds: .
1) You could add a "Topic" to the Gerrit Trigger on Jenkins with something like a "build" value.
It seems this leads to use different methods under the hood which you can approve in jenkins (/code/and /code/) .

The container runs as a jenkins user.
Our private Jenkins server provides a /url/ on the pages it serves up, and I 'm trying to get it to work with the Clover HTML code coverage reports that it serves up.
So you 'll need to amend you Jenkins jobs to run the analysis, either by adding the extra settings and mvn goals; or by using the /url/, but you 'll still need to configure the Jenkins plugin and add an extra step in all of your builds.

Is Jenkins has token mechanism to authorize Jenkins APIs without using username?
I have given jenkins_ec2_role rights to update the Lambda in the other account, but it makes sense that I would need to reciprocate those rights somewhere in Account_Dst -- assuming there is a simple solution to this problem.
I 've seen some Google suggestions that I could use CodePipeline, but obviously I 'm using Jenkins, so that does n't seem like a good solution, either.
Because you are running in a docker container, i am assuming you are also using some form of environmental management (chef, puppet, jenkins) etc.
They will need to use the refresh token, but the new access token will need to be available in future invocations of the Cloud Function (which requires re-deploying to set environment variables) or Docker container (through Jenkins' credential manager to again set environment variables in the container).
I have created one Jenkins pipeline project and taking checkout from BitBucket, Now I want to get all the pull request list in Groovy code so I can use it my pipeline storage.

permissions for the shared folder is the same as the user Jenkins uses.
I enabled 'Debug Mode' in Extended Email Notification under 'Manage Jenkins'.
Ideally I effectively want "pipeline /code/ in Jenkins".
I 'm aware of the "Replay" option, but it 's painfully slow for a remote Jenkins and does n't integrate well into VCS.
Firing up a local Jenkins for testing is not very practical - the pipelines need to interact with a private Docker registry, need a specific plugin config, need some specific worker types, etc.

I 'm trying to launch a Jenkins agent through ECS.
I have been using Bitbucket API to keep track of the version using the API 1.0, where I was able to create using a REST Url query and integrated with Jenkins.
If those vms are connected to your jenkins master as agents, you are free to checkout your Dockerfile and build on one agent (or master), then switch agents and launch your image there.
Running as the user jenkins does n't allow us to clone.
Go to the jenkins home, select Manage Jenkins, then select Manage Nodes.

Now I am trying to automate it through Jenkins build project, so that I get /code/, /code/, /code/ input from user who is executing the Jenkins job and ARM template read this input through system variables instead of asking for input in runtime.
I 'm trying to use variables declared in bash script in my Jenkinsfile (jenkins pipeline) without using extra plugins like EnvInject plugin please help, any idea will be appreciated  .
This python gets the file as a input and check for specific content and replaces the value with the user input provided through jenkins.
We want to put that tool in a Docker container for easily running it locally and with Jenkins, and enabling reproducibility.
/pre/  When I launch the command, after some maven work during the workflow, I am asked for jenkins user password: .

I want to perform SonarQube analysis of a git repository code and I want to use SonarScanner from Docker Container, not from within Jenkins Configuration.
I need to skip the build in the jenkins pipeline for the jobs that do n't need to be built (if there are no code changes) .
I have turned this option off as I do not want Jenkins to build PRs or branches periodically.
Do I combine all the jobs into one Jenkinsfile, or create multiple jenkins files for each of the existing jobs (Jenkinsfilestart, JenkinsfileFetchCVs, JenkinsFileFetchGit, Jenkinsfilenextjob,etc., and have one call the other)?.
Have set up Jenkins pipeline on test VM, but not clear on which way to go yet.
Since this Jenkins job is n't technically started by a user, it has no one to email.
In the beginning of the Jenkins build the user will select if they want to apply or destroy a terraform stack.
Then when the user clicks to approve the destroy, Jenkins will automatically destroy the stack.
You can only reference a single node within /code/, the /code/ allow you to declare multiple labels which jenkins will look for when selecting an appropriate node.
For example when you have agent A with labels /code/ and agent B with /code/, agent C with /code/, /code/ would select node A, B or C depending on executor aviability, which could be a problem when you have mixed in some linux-only /code/ step, thus you can use /code/ to get jenkins to choose one of the latter 2 agents that both contain those labels.

You can now enter the Manage Jenkins >> Manage Plugins section and force the updates.
I am using Jenkins, I a trying to configure Mercurial inside Jenkins.
A caveat - typically we build with /code/ set, or via Jenkins which can be configured to define /code/ per job.

What does  " Jenkins User API key" refers to here?
Is it the API Token name that we enter manually or the random key that Jenkins generates?
Is Jenkins Authentication Token refers to random key that gets generated by Jenkins as API token or some alpha numeric input that I can manually enter in Jenkins Job (Jenkins-> Build Triggers -> Trigger builds remotely -> Authentication Token) .

Jenkins would be good at these points, but feels like a hack.
It also, for some reason, does not show up as an artifact when I click on the job in Jenkins.
I do n't have to do this via the API, I would be open to using a Jenkins plugin if one exists.
But I would like to know how to do the API method if possible as I have no admin rights and Jenkins and have to deal with another group in the company via service tickets to get this done.

If the jenkins user is logged using an identity provider like /code/ on the Jenkins server or the slave server your job is using, the /code/ file of the host will not have the jenkins user.
Is there a way in Jenkins to use a single job to build a Dockerfile from an arbitrary repo, possibly using a single webhook URL for all of the repos?
However, a better way is to use one of the many build automation solutions that are available, such as Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitLab CI.

I have changed some code in git branch and master after cloning i made some changes in master and branch,then I want to push it to git in such a way that the changes made in branch should go to branch and changes in master to reflect to  master without specifying the branch  I want this to be done in a single step so I can automate my workflow using Jenkins and this is a migration task  .
As a training mockup I am trying to setup a jenkins instance behind an nginx reverse proxy ensuring also https.
So I create one container for nginx and one for jenkins.
(a) /code/ contains changes which /code/ does n't contain -> I think that 's not possible because no human and no other Jenkins Job touches remoteB .
Your problem is not related to building your Jenkins agent, but rather using it, correct?
Thus, I thought about the following approach because we use already jenkins, git and ocopus: .
Knowing that the jenkins image default exposed port is 8080, I have set : .
i also run Jenkins on docker also,  using docker-compose  .
I want to create jenkins job for elasticsearch curator.

Now, I want to trigger this jenkins job automatically for every commit made to "Branch2".
Of course I do n't want Jenkins to fully occupy my computer rendering it unusable while doing a build but making it faster would be very useful.
Does anyone know how to change the priority of the Jenkins process so it 's allowed to use more CPU while building?
I am trying to update our build process using groovy pipelines in Jenkins.
'Pipeline-syntax' feature page contains syntax of all the possible parameters made available via the API of the installed plugins of a Jenkins server, using which we can generate or develop the syntax based on our needs.
/pre/  Ideally, I would like to setup Jenkins to delete not only the ones that no longer exist right now, but also automatically delete them in the future when the WorkflowJob is removed.
I have created a jenkins "freestyle" job, in which I am trying to run multiple BDD testing process.
I 'm trying to write a script that quickly checks if our Jenkins plugins are up to date.
I know that this is a built in feature in Jenkins, but for security reasons, our Jenkins instance does n't have internet access.
I also tried using the Static workspace behavior, and that will work, but the problem is that in order for that workflow to work, the person needs to create a workspace manually on the worker of jenkins setup, and then create the job, which is then defeating the purpose of using jenkins at first.
Which made me think, if I use an already existing workspace with D:\ being the root, and use a Temp workspace behavior in jenkins, that it will copy the root settings as well as other ones.
I 'm running this as a daemon so I added my options in /etc/sysconfig/jenkins (I have no idea where this lives in Windows) under JENKINS_JAVA_OPTIONS and added the following java options: .
Added a global variable on Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure System > Global Properties > Checkbox Environment Variable > Add a variable name /code/ and value /code/ .
I know that I can use cleanWs() or deleteDir() to clean up a single workspace from within a Jenkins pipeline.
(2) Jenkins -> Credentials-> Jenkins-> Global credentials (unrestricted) -> Add Credentials -> Kind "Username with password"     provide here user/password here  .

I 'm trying to setup "generic" build system and using Docker with Jenkins to build and run tests with pipeline.
/pre/  If I want to set up job in Jenkins to build one of the directories, I just use  -Dclasspath=src/maindir/dir1 .
That will create a jenkinskey/jenkinskey.pub, without passphrase (since Jenkins would not be able to enter one at runtime).
I believe that Jenkins Docker Plugin always runs containers as the /code/ user.
If you are want to push image on ECR, then you should put every dependency in your dockerfile, like in Jenkins you can run postscript which install depencey for you in containers but that is not the case in AWS ECR.
So my question is that i want to set up a code review flow , the tools i have are : git,gitlab,jenkins.. my idea is like to have a kind of forms or checklists that a member of the team need to fill whenever other member want to merge some new code , if the checklist are filled correctly and the new code is approved by the reviewer then the code should be merge, else the merge request is refused.

In each of those you need to configure the user and token to you jenkins server.
With this you can disable pooling as devops azure will trigger events to you jenkins.
Also, you may need to set required permissions on the volume (depending on jenkins requirement).
That plugin is using .groovy definitions so I think even if someone does n't use Jenkins but using groovy may be able to help.
You can put credentials in Jenkins keystore (Jenkins -> Credentials -> System -> Global credentials -> Add Credentials), and then refer to them in your pipeline using withCredentials block like this: .

My docker enabled jenkins-slaves are configured to have user /code/ who is in group /code/.
Add the user (jenkins) and group (docker) in the Dockerfile of the build-tools and setting these to the hosts UID and GID .
Another found alternative is the chmod777 of all resources, which fully defies the security aspect of not running a Jenkins slave as root user.
I would prefer to use the -u option to containers, but I ca n't find a way to determine the UID and GID on a jenkins slave before starting up the docker agent (/code/ command) from within the Jenkinsfile.
I 'm using a setup with Jenkins setup in Kubernetes, plugin included (via the official helm chart) and I 'm trying to use containers that run once with a command and then exit.

/pre/  However I like to use the python plugin to copy a full script in the interface of Jenkins.
so i 'll get the notification using jenkins and its auto build working.
Yes, it is possible, and there are a couple of strategies for /url/ at the global Jenkins master level.

Ideally if the unix server is allowed access to the jenkins , directly do it from the unix box.
Try "Extended E-mail Notification" in jenkins instead of custom functions.
You can use jenkins Editable Email Notification plugin and in advanced settings you will have an option of failure-X where you can specify after how many failures you need to send the email.
For example, if you want your Jenkins to push built images into ECRs based on the targeted environment (production, staging) residing in different AWS accounts.

If you use Jenkins and just want to create views based on actions in other systems, e.g.
For that create a technical user on denodo and load the driver to the jenkins server.
Not sure if you can create a revision based on vql code that comes from Jenkins, but I think this should be possible.
and /code/ is created by /code/ user so as a result, Jenkins user will get permission denied.
Also, Will suggest to offical Jenkins image instead of messing with ubuntu that is lightweight based on /url/.
I am using Jenkins pipeline to run the tests in parallel, the problem appears when the tests are sent to ReportPortal, they are all in separate launches, what i am trying to do is to set the launch name (the launch number to be precise) for tests manually so they would all be in one launch.
Next to that we also attempted to set them in /code/ on the AMI singling out the ubuntu user which is the user running the Jenkins agent (/url/).

This is a bit tricky though, since this is a Jenkins docker container using an alpine image and I would need to create the users with each pipeline rather than in the dockerfile, which brings me to a whole other drama - to give the Jenkins user sufficient privileges to create and delete users and so on... .
If you want to combine both approaches, you should just use Jenkins instead of Travis CI to run the /code/ command.
As for the user administrative information, the user logged in that is running Jenkins is both the "administrator" and the "hyper-v administrator".
Post Steps used in jenkins  Execute Shell used .
It seems Jenkins starts the container for a docker image in the background via /code/.

The main purpose is that I want to commit some files to SVN repository and trigger the jenkins to build some test automatically.The method I want to use is post-commit hook.
/pre/  what I have done is: 1.change jenkins settings to "Allow anonymous read access" 2.cancel CSRF protection .
I am using simple docker-compose file to pull jenkins image.
I want to fetch data from my sql Table and use them as a choice parameters in Jenkins .
/pre/  I want to use these IDs as a choice parameter in Jenkins in order to build using one of these ID i.e.
Lets say I want SSL/TSL security only for my jenkins-server running inside one of the docker containers; to implement this I am using nginx-reverse-proxy and Let 's Encrypt CA.
/pre/  I found quite a lot of examples of how to use Jenkins variable in Powershell, but not vice versa :( .
You could select to use Jenkin’s Powershell plugin for directly running Powershell scripts on Windows via Jenkins.
Currently I am trying to implement demo for CI/CD pipeline using SVN , Kubernetes and Jenkins.
And I try add next entries jenkins command e.g  -/code/ .
I do n't know why the sed command fails, but if you want to parse JSON like @daggett implied you should use the jenkins native /url/ method instead of the groovy jsonSlurper .
The best way to configure this is Jenkins global configuration -> require authorization for /project endpoint Copy userid and API key for a Jenkins user who has authorization to run the job Create a webhook on GitLab to trigger the job, and use HTTP basic auth: /url/ .
I 'd like to be notified whenever one of my automated tests is not working so that 's why I 'm using Jenkins with Jabber (XMPP) notifier plugin.
Provide your jenkins user name and password  curl -X POST /url/ .
If you wanted to use the jenkins from browser use your ec2 public ip or elastic ip   i.e, PUBLIC_IP:8080 .
In Linux, Jenkins use its own username.
You can use command /code/ switch to jenkins user , then use command /code/ and  /code/ to see the jenkins user 's root path.
Try it again, use /code/ command in jenkins shell and it would work.
I 'm planning on writing a plugin thats main functionality will rely on being able to access node information within the Jenkins servers nodes page such as name, associated jobs etc.
The proxy define in jenkins in correct way ( under plugin -> advance page ).
The other user does not always have access to log into Jenkins thus I can not use input step.
We also use Jenkins for our CI/CD.
I am setting a jenkins job that can build, run unittest etc.
If you are using Jenkins file, you can use stash and unstash feature of Jenkins: .
I tried using web-hooks but it trigger the jenkins job when any commit is made.
The provided key is the id_rsa.pub from the windows node, and the credentials being used stored the private key from the jenkins master.
I can SSH into and out of the node from the jenkins users.
I just want to get a Windows Node setup so our VR Team can begin running builds with Jenkins and Freeing up their PC 's .
If you use Docker inside Jenkins you have to mount the docker.sock of the host as well, if not you can leave out that part.
When I enable /code/ and set a string parameter, what Windows command should I use so the name of the slave agent will be passed to Jenkins and it 'll run all following commands on given slave?
need to create Roles in my Jenkins application, in order to that trying to install "Role-based Authorized strategy" plugin, but in Available folder(where we search for required plugins), Application is showing me following error "There were errors checking the update sites: SocketException: Connection reset" when I click on the "Download now &amp;restart later" button plugin is not installing in my Jenkin Application... can anyone help me what to do .
You can configure the proxy server that Jenkins will use by going to Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins > Advanced.
I could simply start Jenkins using the parameters: .
/pre/  Some plugins do not properly use the proxy settings in Jenkins and I am wondering what the implications would be if I set the proxy in the JVM: .
What are the benefits to set the proxy in Jenkins?
In order to simplify the distribution of this automation, I am attempting to add it to a Jenkins server (see more details from my previous /url/).
I 'm using the Jenkins Email Extension to send automated build emails, and about 1/4th of the time, it just simply will not send.
Nr.4 this container has an image to behave like a Jenkins slave/node (used from dockerhub).
I 'm add in jenkins /code/ and /code/ .
This topic is about Docker networking, which I ca n't get to allow dockerised Jenkins to use a dockerised SMTP server.
But then, in Jenkins > Manage Jenkins > Configure System > E-mail notification, trying to use the test email sending tool gives me following results: .
Currently stuck at the section number 6 - step # 1 - Generating Jenkins URL It asks to copy the public IP of the VCIN and append :8080 to it in order to access the Jenkins application.
/pre/  This reboots terminal but Jenkins then gets stuck and not able to run next sanity testcases using robot framework.
Im using the build monitor plugin (/url/ v. jan'17) to create a Jenkins view on a big screen in the breakroom to display current builds.
I 'm using Jenkins 2.176.3. .
the problem is that I use ngrok now, and every time I want to use jenkins have to change the github webhooks to the current ngrok address that forwards to my machine.
/pre/  Now, I want to create a Job in Jenkins and thus calling below code as provided in API : .
One simple way would be to add a webhook for a Job 'A' on Jenkins 'A' that starts the job, and let job 'B' on Jenkins 'B' trigger this webhook.
You can use Jenkins API to trigger the job on another instance, please see the below API .
3) Lets say I have a bunch of NiFi custom processors that needs to be hosted on git and there is Jenkins in this SDLC.
Solve it by using different types of Jenkins Slaves .
I want to send the status of my build with jenkins and I have configured Email notification in jenkins configure system.
I want to make use of Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins and Gitlab.
This one creates many xunit.xml-s which is something I wanted for jenkins.
In Jenkins, I have defined browser parameters in Jenkins which allows me to run tests on either Chrome or Firefox.
I would use Jenkins basic step.
Goal:  Jenkins should be able to choose for example, at 9H the parameter browser="chrome" and at 9h30 browser="Firefox" without any human intervention .
So when Jenkins gets the notification about the build - it should checkout the source code, run some script (like /code/), show the test results and then as a separate step or from maven to create an image of your application and upload it to some repository or supply it to the kubernetes cluster depending on your actual devops needs.
I had read about Xray plugin for Jira but there the build has to be triggered from jenkins which i do n't need as i want the test execution to be triggered from Jira.
I am able to run the automation from windows terminal with android Gradle task, but when I tried same using jenkins terminal it shows below error: .
However, you might want to consider using /url/ functionality in your Jenkins instance instead.
I can able to trigger jenkins job but I need to use the JIRA custom fields value given in the jira ticket in the triggered Jenkins job.
If you do n't want to have a static hosted Jenkins server , you can go with following two options.
My team is of 8 people who access the Jenkins via browser for performing deployments on demand.
Jenkins starts, loads the plugins, then you can configure via /url/, /url/, etc., similar to you adding via GUI (add, restart, configure).
You should be able to build your Jenkins job against any test list you want, so you now have the ability to run your automation against different tests, as mentioned in your problem description.
In short, using it Code versioning(BitBucket, Jenkins etc) how to integrate and work .
I am trying to build on demand AWS jmeter(can be any testing tool like SOAP UI, Selenium ) instance to using Jenkins.
I want to create a jenkins pipeline job which will take this latest ECR image form repository and put in an Existing EC2 instance,create container from that image and open on some port.
In my current project we are using Jenkins with Docker-In-Docker based approach to build docker images.
In the Additional Behaviors section of the Jenkins configure page, I have /code/ and /code/ with /code/ checked.
I also want to spin up Jenkins without any manual intervention/configuration.
/pre/  The one strange thing about this is that I can get this whole set up to work by saving the global Jenkins configuration without making any changes(Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> Configure System) and then saving the created job itself without making any changes.
You can also use the /url/ in jenkins,  .
However, I want to add an extra UI in Jenkins page, which contains this information.
I plan to add this array in another function, which visualises the information in the Jenkins UI.
If you are using Jenkins pipeline, and the newer declarative style (has a top level /code/ element) then there is a /code/ /code/ that can be used for the overall job, or on individual stages: .
I am using Jenkins-Docker-Plugin/url/ to dynamically create containers and use them as Jenkins Slaves.
If you really want to achieve higher availability in the face of node and/or /code/ failures, and the Jenkins workload you 're deploying has a hard requirement on local volumes for persistent state, you will need to consider an alternative volume plugin like NFS, or moving to a different cloud provider like GKE.
I am trying to implement a Jenkins pipeline whereby I want to control the source code for the pipeline code in git.
I know this is possible using the Jenkins UI using the /code/ pipeline option, however I am trying to understand how I can implement this behavior in Groovy code.
I know how to get all builds from a specific job and know how to get the list of builds from the current user in the Jenkins UI by going to /code/, however, there does n't seem to be an API for that specific address because if you go to /code/ it comes up with a 404. .
During the execution in Jenkins it takes this order, it does n't create from alphabetic.
My second question is: how is the best approach to managing Jenkins pipelines in DSL with use case similar to my - creating similar pipelines in a loop with handling variables.
We have some Jenkins jobs that use Windows batch command steps, and access the repositories using git.exe... .
I 'm trying to create a quicklab on GCP to implement CI/CD with Jenkins on GKE, I created a Multibranch Pipeline.
When I run via artifactory 's jenkins plugin I ca n't really access the shell and need gradle to handle the logging internally.
I want to move Jenkins from one server to another Server/container(docker).
To use Docker in Jenkins, Jenkins must have access to the /code/.
/pre/  Problem is, Jenkins does n't allow this to run on a slave and I 'm not sure how to use /code/ method here because it does n't solve the purpose.
(a) Create a dummy super user via jenkins with a command similar to this: .
I am new to Jenkins and I would like to use it to automate some tasks.
This makes sense if you do CI/CD on your host from within containerized Jenkins.
Now I want to add Sonarqube into Jenkins.
If you are using $PWD following the example on Jenkins site, be very careful about possible space character in the "current" path.
What I want is, that I do n't have to manually add every e-mail address in this list, instead getting the e-mail list from the registered users in jenkins.
We want to run arc diff using a jenkins job which will put out a diff programmatically.
this will launch a remote screen, if your jenkins server allow this... .
I 'm trying to send email notifications to specific user whose branch is currently checked out in the Jenkins build process.
We recently had this issue while trying to run Jenkins using helm.
The issue was in the /code/ container, so the /code/ option allows you to peek at the logs of this container within the jenkins pod.
While I will be in trouble to get a clear full explanation, in short - jenkins push all the code in your scripted pipeline via super-complicated (as for me) set of CPS transforms - /url/ , which may or may not convert groovy API properly.
I am running a parameterized build in Jenkins where certain components that need to be deployed can be selected.
/pre/  is there any way to have the slave-agent run at start-up but also have Desktop interaction when the when I start the Selenium test from a Jenkins build?
I 'd like to start producing them via Fastlane so that they get updated automatically when they get built on a Jenkins job.
I am using Role based strategy plugin in Jenkins to manage user and role in Jenkins.
Is it possible to integrate database into Jenkins such that the users, roles ,permission and project are from my own database instead of manually creating the users, permissions, roles and project?
I have tried manually creating the users, roles in Jenkins based on the database i have and it worked.
I am thinking if there is a more efficient way to create the users and roles in Jenkins from my own database.
All these information should be integrated into Jenkins users, roles, project table.
if you want a Jenkins specific answer: There 's a /url/ to jenkins.
/pre/  This works well, but what I really want is for these stages to appear in the Jenkins UI as /code/ when they do not run, instead of greyed out in state /code/.
I want to be able to ssh that container (remote_host) from another container (jenkins/jenkins) .
/url/I have an HTMl report that needs to be viewable from the Jenkins dashboard.
You can use the Role-based Authorization Strategy plugin (/url/) along with the google login plugin and set different roles to users based on their email from within jenkins.
We would like to implement to trigger jenkins jobs after e-mail approval.

I 'm currently editing the Jenkins' job description using a function in my jenkinsfile:  .
Those are for example two dedicated Jenkins plugis for OAuth .
When I use Jenkins, It is very common to give/change then give parameters to a JOB build.
I need to add a custom logo to my Jenkins page which should appear on login page and post login pages as well.
Our project has multiple areas and currently each area is set up as an independent job in our Jenkins.
I have defined a GIT parameter in my Jenkins job for the user to choose the tag names.
I have to run some containers from the images present in AWS ECR.As i need to automate this i am using Jenkins.
I 'm new to jenkins and I 'm trying to use the credentials in a dsl using the credentials plugin  .
/pre/  I have defined the credentials in jenkins as username with password .
I currently use this in my Jenkins instance for this purpose (using Jenkins ver.
I can access and login to MY_Jenkins_server_public_IP:8080 from my computer and mobile phone.
This will allow jenkins tasks (running by the jenkins user) to run docker commands without /code/.
I 'm trying to setup a build pipeline using Jenkins.
is there a way to implement this in a Jenkins pipeline?
It seems like Jenkins does not support this.
You should store the Jenkins file with your code and use the /url/.
Build Server (remote machine): Produced the public/private key for sudo user "john" using ssh-keygen -t rsa -f jenkins_server_key .
Jenkins Master: Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> SSH Plugin: Added private key value (jenkins_server_key), Hostname and Username details .
I planned to use Katalon (Free) with Jenkins.
Is there a simple way to trigger jenkins job when a specific file is modified in enterprise github?
I tried to setup Jenkins job to run tests using BrowserStack.
Also please note that you should add (if not already done) the credentials of the repository in Jenkins Credentials (/jenkins/credentials/), in the above example is under id /code/ .
But the best practice is to split your SVN repository into several Git repositories (one per "area"), allowing a finer-grained control when it comes to Jenkins.
I have a dockerized Jenkins build server set up like below and I want move it to AWS.
Have in mind that a credentialsId should have been configured in jenkins holding the username/password of the jenkins account and a /code/ class should be set for the download/clone location.
Use "git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master",  before gerrit code review, I want to do some test by Jenkins.
We use the following 2-step tar to build the list; this allows us to traverse Jenkins folders of arbitrary depth without reading the entire directory tree, skipping /code/ and /code/, etc.
So, spin up a Jenkins instance, install the plugin, configure whatever you want in the Jenkins UI and then go to the CasC page and use the configuration export.
Like the connection between Jenkins and Rundeck, is there any way we can trigger a particular job in control-m through Rundeck.
/pre/  And execute /code/ from Jenkins, it will work as you want.
i want to build a jenkins dashboard with angularJS.
You need to install docker, docker-compose, make sure jenkins user is in group docker and set docker group id to docker group id on the host.
Here i want to pull the latest image (with tag 4).I cannot hard-code tag number here as docker pull command will run from Jenkins job automatically.So what way i can pull the latest image ?
This is all done and controlled by a Jenkins file and CI/CD tools like Jenkins and Spinnker etc.
Using Jenkins, you can execute some of these commands too, but it 's easier to use the /url/.
/pre/  I 'm using this approach since it 's simple to pull the Jenkins build file (/code/) as well as the other content of repo to build directly without extra steps.
I know it is possible to remove routes, but as 'cf push' is triggered via a jenkins pipeline in my case I 'd like to define everything in advance in the configuration.
I want to trigger a jenkins build from artifactory .
Get Jenkins port number and enable in Security group.
I want to run build of these N projects in their own separate parallel dynamically created stages (GUI Columns) as seen in jenkins job 's dashboard.
If we want to create separate stages (dynamically) then Jenkins should be able to show console output of a given step/dynamic stage within the parallel section (i.e.
If you see below, we also got individual columns in Jenkins job dashboard for them.
You might want to use Jenkins to automatically deploy your build result to a (testing) kubernetes cluster as well.
Jenkins' most friendly and  simplest solution while dealing with environment variables is to use /url/ .
Permission "Logged In User can do any thing" is selected on Jenkins Config Security.
Here I also noticed that though I am providing correct user name and password/token, that is used to sign in, in to Jenkins server from UI to create  Jenkin server instance as defined in user doc, when it hit to the method, it is logged in as "ANONYMOUS USER" in to jenkin.
Jenkins node / agent / slave launches a /url/, which skips the user .bashrc, only the system ( in /etc) profile.
I have not worked on Jenkins but surely, I have seen people using Jenkins for such things.
You can create a site that will show the results across builds (again, this is   already solved by CI tool like Jenkins) .
I 'm using Jenkins to create a build process.
I m trying to create a Jenkins job to start and stop the Azure VMs.Thing is like whenever I trigger a (Start)job in Jenkins that job needs to start the particular Azure VM and if I trigger a (Stop) job that needs to stop the particular Azure VM.So that I need not give Azure portal access to a developer if he needs to start/stop the Azure VM, all he needs to do is triggering the Jenkins job .
I 'm aware of using Jenkins cli instead of using Jenkins web ui.
I 'm looking for a solution where my CI solution (Jenkins) is able to evaluate if there were any changes in any of the children modules in my SCM since the respective 's build last successful build (not sure the best way to track this last successful build, maybe using git tags).
Jenkins.items gives me list of all items present in Jenkins.
I need to use that in jenkins job, I am not calling /code/ directly, it 's part of process which I cannot change, but I am able to run .
Imagine that you want to manage it programmatically with the automation process in your CI/CD pipeline  such as Jenkins it could be a really painful story  .
/pre/  Disclaimer: I do not have access to Jenkins - was not able to test .
Is it still possible to somehow add the Jenkins CI integration with this setup?
I 'm trying to run my appium test on the BrowserStack device cloud with the use of Jenkins.
/pre/  Currently i 'm using this tools in Jenkins .

You might change the following to fixed port: Jenkins | Manage Jenkins | Configure Global Security Agents TCP port for inbound agents: [o] Random .
In the Jenkins file we set the username and password like this: .
/pre/  I want to implement Jenkins to this method.
I 'm trying to set up Jenkins on my Mac and followed the instructions on the /url/.
When I click the Trigger Jenkins button under Configuration check the job gets triggered and it is running.
If you are inside AWS, you can assign the /url/ to Jenkins server and you will not be required to bind host keys.
/pre/  The problem is the following: I am using k8 and Jenkins.
enter your password, and copy the Jenkins password.
Can I use Jenkins for that?
I want to running my automation testing on git using jenkins by triggered on tortoise SVN changes.
so you 're doing an assume role using /code/ but then your specifying codebuild plugin to use the same creds from jenkins credential store (that you used to perform the assume role).
/pre/  Jenkins nodes are controlled by the agent label, cool :)   .
You need to use set of tools to achieve it SCM webhook/poll, Jenkins, Ansible.
An alternative approach is to use a JAVA Class to read the jenkins var and write to a properties file.
   Edit: I do n't want to have two Jenkins jobs.
In order to do so in your Jenkins Pipeline, in the Build Triggers section tick the following :  .
/pre/  And call it via Jenkins: .
Check if using the file protocol as an URL would be enough to convince Jenkins and its Credential plugin that is does not need username/password: .
You first need to configure the generic webhook plugin in jenkins to trigger the job you want.
If you have multiple jobs in jenkins and you only want to trigger a specific one you can use /url/.
You may want to use a different, more terminal oriented bundle of Appium (for example /url/) and automate it with a tool like Jenkins.
use this password in jenkins job.
I 'm trying to follow this jenkins tutorial: .
but I 'm trying to do that within a dockerized jenkins.
make sure that your default user inside your bulid container can run docker (add jenkins user to docker group) .
So I will give you the solution I used to solve this problem with the use of jenkins 's influxDB plugin with InfluxDB as a database and Grafana as a Dashboard tool.
I updated System Preferences --> Privacy &amp; Settings --> Developer Tools to include allowing every program I could think of that might be related (including all xcode tools, codesign, java, and several others I thought could be related to anything Jenkins might try to do), but this alone did n't make a difference .
Is it possible to configure Jenkins to ignore the group membership and use the attribute type?
/pre/  i tried workarounds like going to Jenkins serve and selection option of user interaction.
I have a single repository consisting of various microservices written in node js, I am trying to deploy by triggering a Jenkins pipeline for those microservices where a change is done and trying to maintain only one Jenkins file for the repository.
I 'm building something similar with my pipeline stages encapsulated in containers orchestrated by Kubernetes and I 'm able to source modules from my private bitbucket server using the ssh-agent Jenkins plug-in inside /code/ image based container via git+ssh seamlessly.
Can any one has idea to work with Database, nodejs via jenkins builds?
I am trying to use Azure VM agent plugin in Jenkins setup to build a scalable slave solution.
I use Jenkins for Continuous Integration, and I plan to add SonarQube to it.
Now, I would like to serialize this @Singleton to support the resume feature of Jenkins pipelines.
Configure the tests in non GUI Mode in Jenkins.
Basically, here is my process - Building docker image using Jenkins and uploading to Nexus.
But that is the user on jenkins system.
My jenkins is set with when a change is pushed to GitLab will auto triger the jenkins pipline, In this condition, I find I can not get the user who made the change on gitlab.
So the question is if there is a way to make jenkins get the user who made changes on gitlab?
Installed Jenkins master on one cluster and trying to create slaves in another cluster using Kubernetes plugin.
I am trying to run test cases which belong a web Gui1 via Jenkins.
We use the JobDSL plugin to implement a Jenkins Seed Job.
I need to check if a folder exists in Jenkins and only create it if it does n't.
Required Solution: I thought on creating ability automatically to restart Jenkins Slave before each run.
In short, Jenkins spawns processes that spawn other processes that are owned by different users in the filesystem (e.g.
not in $JENKINS_HOME), and thus are not owned by the jenkins user.
It is possible to use /code/ or /code/ on the log files in the Jenkins build itself.
Are there any Jenkins properties to enable concurrent builds from within a pipeline?
(we are using jenkins for CI) .
I wanted to use Jenkins to automate these steps.
Therefore i start Jmeter in GUI-Mode through Jenkins (using a batch file) with activated Script Recorder.
I 'm using /url/ plugin of Jenkins to highlight failures.
I am trying to integrate protractor test cases in jenkins.
There 's a /url/ in Jenkins when you update the /code/ in pipeline it only takes effect after another build.
I want to be able to use a method from a Jenkins plugin via its java class .

I 've been trying to setup CI/CD for my ECS cluster using jenkins.
I have added the configMap to my Jenkins DC and it looks like this: .
I 'm using Jenkins to test the setup, so I must not have something that appears as a window or splash.
Solution 1 - You can add a simple conditional check-in your Jenkins, for the first time if deployment does not exists create it and set it to the first image.
Currently there have been ansible script based automation orchestrated via Jenkins but look forward for anything which are at good scale to have the solid automation framework.
Attached are my settings of jenkins.
Because the /code/ image sets everything up for the root user only, which is not what Jenkins runs as.
Make sure your Jenkins slave user has permissions on the folder.
Inside Jenkins, I have a stage that looks like this: .
It says "go to /Users/Eamon/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword" .
I 'm using jenkins and using the "Execute windows batch command" item .
I have Jenkins file which create Docker image now i want to push that image to AWS ECR.Do i have to create a special IAM user and provide its access and secret access keys ?
Environment variables override the configuration values specified in /code/, and are the best way to configure your settings on a CI environment like Jenkins.
/pre/  But here the problem is my Jenkins is on-Premise so i just cannot simply create and attach AWS role to deploy the template.Also i cannot use credentials/access keys of users in my job.So which other ways i can achieve this ?
You want to be able to add new projects to Jenkins to be built and deployed to your test integration environment but you do not want manually change the branch name in each Jenkins project when the branch changes, when you need to work on a different feature.
In Jenkins use /code/:  .
Following are the settings that I 've applied inside Manage Jenkins -> Configure System .
/pre/  Is there an example regarding how to set up and use this plugin, and also how to relate it to Jenkins?
What I want to achieve is I want to make request github 's deployment api and handle by jenkins then starts building with spesific environment and tag version.
I 'm able to use @Grab annotation in Jenkins pipeline script in both, sandbox and non-sandbox mode.
I 'm using the MS Test plugin in Jenkins and I want to use vstest.console.exe.
I 'm trying to set up a Jenkins pipeline (using the declarative syntax) that runs unit and feature tests on two separate, on-demand AWS EC2 instances.
You can use /code/ to parse /code/ to /code/ object in a Jenkins Pipipeline.
I want to give input from jenkins to run only CLAs.xml file.
This has the added benefit of being whitelisted so you can use it a locked down Jenkins.
I looked for an alternative to run CI in my network using Jenkins and git webhooks, but with this method, I do n't see the status on each build, in the bitbucket next to each commits, so I need to manually login to Jenkins to check it out, which defeats the point of CI.
If you are running Jenkins inside your AWS and you using the secret key and access key you are violating best practice.
You should create an /url/ which has specific role and that role allow Jenkins only to push the image to ECR.
In this case, how to identify what are methods available on Jenkins objects?
Like checking what user made the commits (if it 's the jenkins SVN user, then ignore these revisions) or adding some extra code or conditions for checking this manually before triggering?
So for Jenkins you must set it back.
I am using my enterprise jenkins to create pipeline.
/pre/  I 'm looking to automate the testing script when jenkins use it to deploy it will use production and during testcomplete it will use the staging .

I 'm trying to implement some functionality using a static variable in my shared library in Jenkins.
I 'm trying to find Jenkins pipeline feature in UCD where deployment is automated without any click.
solution 2 is not work because I run jenkins in docker and I do not have jenkins user.
I am trying to map peoples GitHub accounts with their Slack names so I can send a notification via Jenkins to that person but true values are evaluating to false and vice versa when I use the Elvis operator  .
I 'm not completely sure it covers your certificate use case, but since it took me some time to find out, I still want to share this snipped that retrieves the email address for a given user name in Python without special Jenkins libraries.
So is it possible to have multiple jenkins file with custom name ?
I want to upload to WebLogic using groovy code inside Jenkins job pipeline.
This needs to be done entirely in the terminal because it will be automated by Jenkins.
I am new to Jenkins and I am using /url/.
To make it more dynamic, Make your jenkins build parameterized.
/pre/  But when I enable reporting in jenkins all results come together and it 's hard to identify based on suites.
In jenkins, I can create such a web interface with /url/.
Also you should check that you jenkins client runs with the admin rights, so it can run its child processes as administrator.
I have a parameterized job which starts from Jenkins UI by user.
I want to set defaultValue for "props" for user from variable defProps on Jenkins UI.
I am using jenkins to trigger the builds .
Added Credentials my windows login details as Global and linked this credentials with Jenkins logged in user.
I want Jenkins to use my windows credentials to run this powershell but that is not using the same which I have given and its throwing error as User do not have access .
However to master we merge only the stable commits from the develop branch in an automated way via Jenkins.
Now I want to integrate with Jenkins.
It forces you to use a "polling" based architecture, whereby Jenkins asks Bitbucket on specified intervals if changes have been made.
In my case, I am using a "push notification" type of architecture so that Bitbucket notifies Jenkins when specific events occur.
Even further, many people only offer answers with respect to the /code/ plugin on the Jenkins end - but the /code/ 's author allows users to use the /code/ plugin instead, compounding problems researching a solution.

We have three jenkins jobs namely stop_web, stop_app and stop_db each needing different set of parameters and three different URLs.
Is it possible to create and run Docker containers for CI/CD from within a running Jenkins Docker Container?
By running the following command I create a Jenkins Container that I give permissions to Docker (so I thought): .
/pre/  Within Jenkins I create a Pipeline that loads a /code/ from Git that looks like this: .
This also gets around Jenkins permissions the restrict doing things like list.inspect() .
I currently have a shell script that I want to use as part of a Jenkins/Docker job that clones all of the repos from my organization that are tagged with a specific language.
/pre/  You would not need to use Jenkins or anything like that, though - if you setup your JMeter Process to include the Beanshell-server (see the link above) then you can simply replace the code in your post-processor: /code/ .
The final step I want is to automatically merge and close the PR when jenkins has approved.
I see two possible solutions, either bitbucket has something built in so I can call the merge for the given PR from jenkins with a plugin in jenkins/add it to the Jenkinsfile .
Now, I 'm using declarative pipeline and writing Groovy code in Jenkins UI itself which is not helping with auto-population of methods on objects, auto-import etc.
Others have said to use Jenkins and all that stuff.
I 'm trying to set up Sonarqube to run with Jenkins.
Extra option: Makes no sense if you just want to make use of a single Jenkis server but it 's always possible to install a OS like Ubuntu using an image and install the jenkins .war file from there .

In your Jenkins instance, /url/ of type SSH Username with private key.
Another method is to use SSH Agent Plugin in Jenkins.
If you are using older jenkins or other automation tool, which exploit used.
I 'm not using CI or Jenkins as described in /url/.
", there is no ssh key as i 'm using git@github.com:Repo, so i used credential binding plugin to pass the git global credentials that i have generated and authenticated with my git account(works fine), i saved the key in a variable as per the plugin, echo to my the dynamic docker jenkins agent during build, but it fails seeking a passphrase which ive never set, so is there a better way to inject the ssh key to a docker on runtime.
then jenkins would automatically add the configured options to the running container, like /code/...   (I do n't know if there 's a way to do this, that 's part of the question) .
I 've historically used jenkins for CI, and was able to use a /code/ plguin to, as the name implies, publish HTML that would appear on the job page.
I 'm converting a Jenkins job which has been configured in the UI to one that is configured using a declarative pipeline script.

I have two digital ocean droplets - one set up for Jenkins and the other for my Node.js app and I have an ssh key-pair setup between them so Jenkins can deploy to the app server.
My question is if I take regular snapshots of these machines and need to restore them from the snapshot to new droplets, will I have to regenerate the key pair to continue using Jenkins to deploy, or will the original key pair work as they 're both clones of the old machines?
There is a tool /code/ which does what you want and it can be integrated with Jenkins or other CI.
I am writing a plugin for gerrit 2.16.12 that should show a button for starting an extended build stage on our Jenkins for a particular change.
I am a beginner user in jenkins.
In windows, Jenkins will use the the SSH key of the user it is running as, which is located in the %USERPROFILE%.ssh folder ( on XP, that would be C:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME.ssh, and on 7 it would be C:\Users\USERNAME.ssh).
Therefore, you need to force Jenkins to run as the user that has the SSH key configured.
Go to Jenkins, right click, and select  "Properties".
Under the "Log On" tab, choose the user Jenkins will run as, and put in the username and password (it requires one).
Jenkins does not support passphrases for SSH keys.

Check also which user is actually running Jenkins: its /code/ might differ from your current local user.
It seems   like, in this case, Jenkins would be considered "stateful."
I 'm looking something similar to jenkins jobs status.
We have an exception, however, which is a flag we want to control with a toggle in Jenkins.
Solution: The best practice for storing credentials, api tokens and secret keys is to store it on global credentials in jenkins ( this applies to all scope of credentials in the project/item/object) and get it pipeline code.
Jenkins -> Credentials -> Global -> Add Credentials -> Select your   type and fill in the details .
You can use cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword to read it.
But for this to work correctly the user needs to be in the /passwd directory of the image  to work around this you can add the host (Jenkins)  /etc/passwd directory  to the docker image and use a non root user.
You do n't see the Jenkins agent window  .
from scripts)', but I think because I use Jenkinsfile (and not the Jenkins 's GUI), I do n't have option to save the token in the project settings.
To quickly abort the push build in Jenkins is also a good solution.
Edit: I do n't want to have two Jenkins jobs.
I have jenkins pipeline that was build in parallel, and when I go to /code/, I can see logs like that: .
Can you please suggest possible options to capture the metrics from Kafka topics to calculate the performance of Springboot apps (Message Formatter and Message Transformer apps deployed via Devops pipeline using Jenkins)?
I know the easiest way is to call the git repo directly as &amp; when required by adding a Jenkins step, however, that is not the solution I am looking for.
When you put @NonCPS on a method, Jenkins will execute the entire method in one go without the ability to pause.
We are trying to scan individual python files using the Veracode to assess the security vulnerability of the same using Jenkins job.
As far this step is a concern, it would more easy to do with /url/ as there is no out of the box feature in Jenkins which can detect changes in ECR image.
If you are looking for this thing in Jenkins, then you have to manage these things at your end.
re-use the image name and Create Task definition in your jenkins job /url/ or /url/ with same image name .
