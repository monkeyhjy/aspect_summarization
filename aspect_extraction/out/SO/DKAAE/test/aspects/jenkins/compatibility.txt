In the Jenkins batch script, add a "set" command near the top of the script to dump the environment variables for your running script into your Jenkins build log (you can remove the set command after this is debugged).
2) Another possibility is that the environment in which your service is running is different than the environment you get when you open a command prompt on your desktop (because the Jenkins service runs as a different user than the one you log in as.)
Adding "set" to your Jenkins batch commands will help debugging this too, since it will show you the environment your Jenkins script is running in.

/pre/  Then you could run it with a full path in the jenkins script, symlink it, add it to $PATH etc... .
I am using Jenkins 2.11 version with extended email plugin (v 1.61).
Jenkins version is 2.107.3 My master (Linux) and slave (Windows) are both on Azure.
My guess: Jenkins runs on a version of Jetty which provides an old version of UriBuilder which somehow "wins" against the new version of UriBuilder from javax.ws.rs-api 2.0.1?
I have two different Jenkins instances with different versions.
In 0.6 version, I have the same problem in Jenkins "Free-style" project.
I have installed groovy on the slave computer and configured Jenkins to use it.
I think it happened after I upgraded the Jenkins version.
Is it possible to tell Jenkins to only create a local workspace on the machine and not create the workspace on the Perforce server.
We 're using Jenkins LTS 2.107.2 and up-to-date Pipeline plugins (I do n't know which version is of special interest).
you need to have JDK install paths defined in your Jenkins configuration.
Also if you are using master slave configuration you need to make sure that the particular has the same JDK installed (on the same location) as defined in Jenkins configuration.
I would like to put under version control the TFS build &amp; release configurations, something like /url/ for Jenkins.
Got this fixed by reinstalling jenkins under a new server.
Probably this is the default behavior in latest versions of Jenkins.
/pre/  Here is the Jenkins Build shell command that I used: .
NOTE: both Jenkins instances are located on different machines.
We have a Jenkins instance with aws cli installs as well as a pinned boto version.
Currently i have image build process via jenkins that launches agents on ppc64le and x86 architecture.
First, you can install the /url/ which I believe is packaged with Jenkins, so you do n't need to reach out to download it.
I want to know how to deploy two different .jar files on the same port using Jenkins.
/pre/  And got the below message after installing python-jenkins: .

I have a configured Jenkins on my /code/ with several installed plugins and important jobs.
I can run one script in Jenkins using shell command - /code/ (this script does n't have any external packages imported).
I am working on File Operations Plugin- fileCopyOperation in Jenkins pipeline (Jenkins version - v2.73.2 ,Jenkins pipeline - 2.5) i need to copy file from one location to the other location with different folder structure.
I compiled code in my local setup, it went successful but in Jenkins environment kernel version is appending with "dirty" string.
/pre/  But if your port 8080 is already is in use,so you have to change the Jenkins port number, so for that open Jenkins folder in Program File and open Jenkins.XML file and change the port number such as 8088 .
My Jenkins builds are 5 to 20 times slower on my build agents while using Jenkins and as compared to  - running the build in command line on the build agents - running the build on my workstation .
I have installed  Jenkins using docker.Albeit, I have skipped the manual setup.
Use the latest version of Jenkins to roll out this error.
Jenkins version: 2.107.2 Bitbucket PR builder plugin version: 1.4.26 .
When I try to run the same on my Jenkins which is installed on a VM my test fails.
(.jenkins/jenkins-slave.exe uninstall) Use the .jnlp or slave.jar to connect the machine as a slave.
How can I find the OS of the machine in which Jenkins is installed from Jenkins ?
For instance, for a CI environment you can configure a Jenkins project to use the /url/ to poll and look for changes or build periodically on a schedule, and then use your build/deployment scripts, such as /url/ build to deploy to MarkLogic with the appropriate target (i.e.
Do you have the JIRA PLUGIN installed in jenkins if not get it and set it up .
Whatever is running Jenkins, it looks like /code/ is n't in its path.
Ensure, that your plugin supports at least Jenkins version 2.3, and make sure you have imported package /code/ from /code/.
I currently have Jenkins check all the different repositories and execute a shell script that calles /code/.
I am setting CI with .net projects but I having troubles when I try configure the restore using bath command line into Jenkins like this: .
/url/ for generated syntax for your version of Jenkins and plugin versions .
Jenkins is installed in a local server inside our local network.
Any variables that seemed relevant that the Terminal environment and the Jenkins did n't I placed into /etc/environment file (Jenkins takes additional environment vars from there) .
Is it from clearcase UCM, or from the Jenkins I installed?
Those fields are visible only because you have installed the "clearcase-ucm-plugin" for Jenkins.
How it works differently in Jenkins and cmd?
But it seems like The Terraform Has to be installed on the same vm as Jenkins(or on /var/lib/jenkins/workspace)  Is there anyway to get this done?

i added on Jenkins in maven configuration exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=main, and it works thanks .
I just upgraded the jenkins from 2.63 to 2.117 (Which I 'm regretting now) .
/pre/  Note: Others who are using older version of jenkins, there is a big chance that all your jobs will be messed up.
Reach out to install folder of Jenkins: C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins .
We had a pipeline plug-in installed on Jenkins.
How do I upgrade Jenkins to use a more recent version?
/pre/  I have tried downloading node v8.11.1 to the /home/jenkins/.nvm/versions/node/, copying gulp, nodemon and bower to the bin directories and using /code/ to switch my node versions  .
The shared library is loaded via the standard method under Manage Jenkins > Configure System .
so do check the space of your machine where jenkins is hosted.
Our build server Jenkins does n't really play either, so we still need to have the output css/js in the version system to allow the build server to build the solution.
With "truss -e -o /tmp/truss_ssh_cli.txt ssh -V" I found out that when run from jenkins, jenkins ( or someone ) set LIBPATH to /opt/freeware/lib, and then ssh get openssl from there.
PRQA is only running on an old version of Jenkins.
In latest version of Jenkins, the devil-Jenkins will appear when you change settings.
Once the xml file generated, that will be available at the Jenkins-host:${WORKSPACE} .
Notes: ${WORKSPACE} is an env variable set by Jenkins.
I have written stages in jenkins file to build jar file and it 's working fine.Next stage is  'deployment' where i have to move jar file to Linux server and run it there.
If you wish to upgrade that docker daemon, you should follow the instructions for docker install/upgrade relevant for the platform that jenkins is running on.
I am trying to set  JAVA_HOME in my Jenkins to run a maven project.
/usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64/bin/java is not a directory on   the Jenkins master (but perhaps it exists on some agents) .
/pre/  Actually a little bit shorter version for those who want to get the params for the current build from the previous run and is working on new 2+ Jenkins versions.
I installed docker and /url/ on the Jenkins machine and run it with   /code/ it is not a Jenkins plugin but it works.
I installed Jenkins on Ubuntu.
Why ca n't work use Jenkins' shell command?
We are running Java 8 and i have set Jenkins to use Java 8 in the config file.
For Jenkins version 2.125 the following worked.
The initiation /code/ will upgrade the version as well if you installed Jenkins using yum as well.
Shebang instruction is ignored on Windows when given in Jenkins 'Execute shell' box, so if we have multiple shells installed on windows slave (MINGW_32, MINGW_64, CYGWIN64, Ubuntu Bash), it is not possible to force the script to be run inside a specific shell by specifying the shebang instcution - it just does n't work.
We managed to run  'repo sync' on the windows slave from jenkins on the MINGW64 shell - which comes with Git for windows installation.
We installed 'Bash on Ubuntu on Windows' on a non-jenkins machine and tried  'repo sync' from there and voila!, it complete in a couple of mins.
Edit the file .config, it must have the below sintaxe  commands:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; command1:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command: mkdir /opt/jenkins &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command2:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;command: chmod 644 /opt/jenkins .
The example you have shown above does not work in my local bash as well as in the Jenkins server .
/pre/  and then i faced that "Jenkins" user do n't have authority to run sudo command so i have edited the file name "VISUDO" .
after this you can execute shell command from jenkins ( add build step / execute shell) and enter below command .
Furthermore Jenkins expects the /code/ to be composed of a package name followed by a single dot and then a class name: .
/pre/  If no dot is present, Jenkins assumes the package "root".
Check your Jenkins agent (I assume  Linux one): see: .
I have got a update for Jenkins, current version (Jenkins ver.
How to upgrade Jenkins excluding that particular ansible plugin changes .
OS: Rhel7 current version:Jenkins ver.
/pre/  Then I try a lot of methods, only the system OpenJDK is work (chose JDK with System on the Jenkins project) .
I also check the mvn and java in the Jenkins master(I use Docker to run the Jenkins), the JAVA_HOME is the OpenJDK and the mvn is not set.
I have installed Jenkins by deploying its WAR file to weblogic sever.
Under available tab there were no plugins showing at first.So, I did some research and i fixed it by using Jenkins->Configure Global Security Click the checkbox for "Use browser for metadata download" Now under INSTALLED tab there are no plugins installed whatsoever.

I am creating a Jenkins pipeline for which I have to clone two branches master and devlop branch to workspace into different directories and compare the files and pull only the changed files to a different directory.
i have cloned those 2 branches to separate directories in Jenkins work space  .
So as a workaround we can compile debug builds using jenkins and simply giving delphi the *.res files from its release folder.
Check your PATH when the Jenkins pipeline does execute itself, and see if you have installed Jenkins plugins recently.
First I ran Jenkins on my local machine, and I got it working fine.

I have resolved this issue by just installing a java 7 on the windows server with the constraint, but the java 7 is n't configured in the path variable i have kept a command handy with the complete path of bin directory of the java 7 installed on the windows so i can connect via slave.jar to my jenkins server giving the path and executing the slave.jar with java 7 so that i dont get a major minor version error, and later on since its not in the path further use java 6 for later processing of windows server.
On Docker image, you have to install Jenkins slave jar in correct location.
It can be found /url/ and should be installed "/usr/share/jenkins/" .
I do n't know if you still need an answer but with a colleague we had the same problem and it seems like that our Jenkins was to old and installed the older plugin version.
In addition to that, from which version of Jenkins version are supported by Java 1.8..??
Jenkins version 2.54 and higher not only supports, but requires Java 8 to run.

Jenkins.wrapper.log has a line indicating the incorrect path to Java: - Starting C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_141\bin\java -Xrs -Xmx6g -Dhudson.lifecycle=hudson.lifecycle.WindowsServiceLifecycle -jar "C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\jenkins.war" --httpPort=8080 --webroot="C:\Program Files (x86)\Jenkins\war" .
Those jar files belong to several dependencies wich I have no control whatsoever and could be any number of files, also I ca n't replace them in the nexus before testing nor place them in my local repo, since the idea is to generate the war file in other machines using jenkins to test the jars.
jenkins version 2.107 .
Why would it work from my machine and not from Jenkins?
I am using version number jenkin plugin in Jenkins ver.
We are running JMock 2.8.3 with JUnit 4.11 and have a test that fails under Netbeans and Jenkins (using the Netbean 's Ant scripts), but passes under Eclipse.
I have my Jenkins with Selenium plug-in installed.
BUT, when I installed Jenkins locally on my machine, and run my project with Chrome, it hangs through Jenkins.

I have a Jenkins v2.107.2 instance (running as a Windows service) which is checking out several projects via Subversion from a Visual SVN Server (on a seperate Windows PC).
/pre/  Previously, some combination of downgrading Jenkins &amp; the Subversion plugin by one version resolved this error, but despite having not changed versions since, this no longer works.
The other code is working fine when I run it in the Jenkins, but it does not set the default download directory correctly and the files are not getting downloaded to the intended directory.
And your Jenkins needs to deploy to different cluster depending on your pipeline.

/pre/  Environment variables come from Jenkins and are the same used in our maven builds.
The Clearcase system is highly dependent on the /vob/ directory, but we need to make this more dynamic for our Jenkins builds to be happy.
This plugin lets you declare multiple versions of Node.js Jenkins tools, and then gives you some pipeline syntax to select the Node version + even an npmrc file for when you need to specify registry or something.
However, the issue come in that locally built projects have a different version than our Jenkins built packages.
Our local builds use a different versioning system from our Jenkins builds so that you can easily tell whether something was built using Jenkins, or if some of the .dlls came from a developer 's build.
Should I delete the new Jenkins installation?

However, it does not run when I try to build it in Jenkins.
To resolve this issue, you should make sure you have the .NET Framework 4.5.1 Targeting Pack installed on the Windows agent where Jenkins installed at first.
If it was already installed on the Windows agent, then you should to verify if .net framework reference path on the jenkins machine matches on your local machine.
If not, you can use the parameter /code/ with MSBuild command line to overwrite the .net framework path when you build solution with jenkins, like: .

When Jenkins is uninstalled the command line execution starts working fine again.
Use case: I have a Jenkins pipeline to update my development environment.
To help with that, I created a new repository to keep all the different environment configurations, and my plan is to have a clone of this repo in all my development and test environments, so when I need to change something, I can just do it locally, push it, and have my jenkins pipeline update the repository in whichever environment it is updating.
   I have no jdk section in my jenkins configure system.
After the update, xcode and running xcodebuild manually worked fine, BUT Jenkins could not sign the app.
Installed jenkins.
Probably the /code/ version in your Jenkins server or agent is old.
In current situation our versioning follows major, minor, revision, build [i.e testjar-1.0.0.1.jar], but every time when build is triggered through jenkins, new jar file is created with new version number.
If your jenkins is installed as a service it executes the scripts as administrator/system and environment variables set on user level will be not taken into account.
Second i removed the PATH environment variable in the jenkins build agent configuration and created a symbolic link in /usr/bin for docker.
I was wondering if there is a way to specify slave.jar which is compatible with jdk 1.7 in Jenkins instance  .

The solution that I came up with was to use the Jenkins Environment Variables in the system settings and it worked fine.
In Jenkins I have an empty build with a build step configured to run the NUnit tests.
The JDKs and Maven are managed and specified under "Manage Jenkins" -> "Global Tool Configuration" -> "JDK installations" and "Maven Installations" :- this worked as it helps in providing the required jdk version using the dropdown option and once we start to build any project, the jenkin will automatically download the jdk and the compilation error will not appear.
Here you can set the tool to a static path, or let Jenkins handle the installation for you.
Jenkins appears to be treating your two lines as two separate commands.
I have it working on my local machine, but not on our CI (jenkins) machine.
My setup was: A Mac Mini running Mac OS Sierra with jenkins and docker both installed locally.
This did not work for me if I appended /bin this path as the docker plugin I was using in Jenkins does this automatically.

I have installed Jenkins as a windows service.
No, in the /code/ build step, you can only execute commands which are available to the shell therefor you have to install /code/ on your system and it must be accessible by jenkins.
Jenkins defines a GIT_BRANCH environment variable.
Can we use /code/ command in Jenkins shell without locally installing it?
I 'm running Jenkins ver 2.89.2 with SonarQube Scanner plugin ver 2.4 When running the scanner for MSBuild, it appears to be working, I see lines such as this in my logs: .
Some background: I had installed the current version of the SonarQube scanner, but then discovered that it was not compatible with my version of Jenkins.
Worked well when the tests ran on Jenkins build server.
However because this is declared on bash_profile jenkins does not recognize the command because it does not make the source of bash profile, so I added /code/ before the ant command so jenkins user can source the environment variables necessary to run the commands .

I am trying to backup jenkins home directory (/home/ubuntu/.jenkins/) using rsync to the target directory /opt/jenbkup/.
The issue was that I was installing Java automatically for the Jenkins run and this was overwriting the installation .
Need to install Jenkins slave on that machine.
I have added the log4j.xml file to the project build path and seems to work fine when run using  'mvn test' on CLI but the logs are n't recorded when run through Jenkins.
The logs are placed in the local directory as expected on Maven run specified in the /code/ file but not on Jenkins run.
If you are building your solution in cloud or in any domain servers then you might have to get the Jenkins integrated in the same environment.
Does anybody know why Jenkins is using different workspaces and why on every workspace Jenkins has a copy from the git repo ?
For every build run in parallel, Jenkins will create a new workspace by default.
I have installed Jenkins on Windows10.
/pre/  I have installed cygwin on windows and set the executable on Jenkins cygwin64/bin/sh /url/ .
I need to setup a build configuration in Jenkins so that whenever a build is triggered, I get my latest scripts from Gitlab and copy them to the target systems and run that script on the target.
I am using Jenkins version 2.158 .
So for my Jenkins builds I will add /code/, and another to remove the local dev package install prefix.
The rest of the file is not processed fine if we change bash to other shell (not odd) nor removing the -e option (if I do that, the entrypoint does not find the jenkins.sh script).
Jenkins is looking for your Maven bin folder inside /code/ which does n't exist.
Then I install the jenkins-x system: .
This works fine, the application is picked up by jenkins is compiled, which I can see in: .
1.Install Active Choices Plugin in your Jenkins.
Jenkins is not creating a new folder for each build by default unless running in parallel, but if you have 12 different jobs, it creates at least one folder for each job.
Then created a new jenkins project and added a build step /code/ and then add all the above commands.
Shall I use different project name for every Jenkins build, or is it ok to use the same project name for all builds?
The feature is already available in Jenkins and we do n't have to install any plugin for it.
I cannot changes release.groovy script as it is global file.. how can I run the Jenkins job with the format "JDK 8" instead of "1.8" and "maven 3.5.3" instead of "3.5.3" .

As you can see, each new Jenkins deploy will update corretly the deployment but creates a new ReplicaSet without removing the old one.
/pre/  If I run this in AWS CLI it subscribes correctly and adds the FilterPolicy, but does n't add the FilterPolicy if run in Jenkins.
But, if I pass a Jenkins created environment variable i.e.
In case it is of any relevance, the Jenkins Environment Injector plugin is v2.1.6 and the Parameterized Trigger plugin is v2.35.2.
Active choices plugin and build flow plugin are not compatible with the current jenkins version 1.642 which i am using.
In our jenkins2 pipeline we use docker-compose for some of our tests and our docker-compose file gets its network name from a combination of the branch name (git) and its build number.
Windows (Jenkins) to linux - use /url/ which is command line putty .
Linux (Jenkins) to linux - use /url/ and /url/ .
Set the environment variable /code/ before launching your web container, or before launching Jenkins directly from the WAR file.
If you 're using the Maven Project type, please note that it needs to   use a JDK capable of running Jenkins, i.e.
If you   configure an older JDK in a Maven Project, Jenkins will attempt to   find a newer JDK and use that automatically.

In your local Jenkins delete everything in /code/ directory then put all /code/ in this directory.
I need to install a very recent version of CMake on top of a jenkins Docker container.
I know this is an old issue, but I ran into this recently myself and found that when you run the containerized version of Jenkins, the configuration files are stored in: .
If I erase the packages folder on the build server and then call the same /code/ from the command line, that Jenkins is configured to call, then only 64 packages are restored .
Your Jenkins is already configured in your local windows-10 but you show us a link to Create a Jenkins server on an Azure Linux VM from the Azure portal.
But what I need is something like in this Python Package, example 1, to get some information about the Jenkins software itself, something like version, install Date, plugins... .
Jenkins is configured with a build process that calls /code/ and restores 64 packages .
If you install this on your Jenkins master (which is also running on a pod) and also if you configure it to talk to the same Kubernetes cluster (meaning the kube-apiserver) then you can create/remove pods using the plugin.
Obviously it is linked to the depreciation of TLS1.1 and 1.0, but I did check the jenkins slave JDK, it is JDK1.8.0.
The script did not work because it requires build-name-setter plugin installed in Jenkins.
Tried to create a folder/file giving windows path to see, if it creates that folder or file on Windows, but it is creating on Jenkins master only.

I want to install an older version of black duck detect plugin in my ci Jenkins.
My ci Jenkins version is 2.41.
It looks like pip is not installed in the server/environment where jenkins is running.
following problem: I 'm running a Jenkins on one machine under Windows, on another Unix- Machine there 's a Tomcat with some web-applications which I deploy with Jenkins.
I 'm trying to setup jenkins in my local machine where perforce is also installed.
I can pass it same in the docker file and I can run but back to zero again need to propagate same docker image (build) in all the environments just need to change the application.properties depends on the environment which I wish to deploy using Jenkins.
Currently, my ci Jenkins version is 2.41. .
After going through some of the earlier posts, I got a solution which stated: You need to download the older version of Black Duck hub plugin in .hpi format and place it in your plugins folder manually and then manually restart your Jenkins which would fix your problem.
Then set that mavenSettings.xml to the Maven instalation used by Jenkins.
Make a backup of your %JENKINS_HOME% directory which you can use to restore to go back to a working stable installation of Jenkins.
Defining a JAVA_HOME environment variable in the Jenkins environment will be enough:  .
/pre/  if you run Jenkins in a container, just define JAVA_HOME in the docker run command: .
But when starting Jenkins I 've got a fresh install and all my setup is overwritten.
Assuming you 're using a recent version of Jenkins, one neat trick is to use Stdout to populate the groovy variable of the Jenkinsfile.
I 'm guessing it 's because my version of jenkins is old.
/pre/  Since I already know that my java PATH variables are defined in /etc/environment file, I added that file to the top of /etc/init.d/jenkins file .
/pre/  you can even remove the PATH from /etc/init.d/jenkins file, since it 's already defined in /etc/environment .
In Build Tab --> click on -> Add build step --> select Execute shell --> This will give you a command Box --> Just add the path of your script where you have saved it on your local  example : sh /var/tmp/xyz.sh Please note the script should be on the server where the Jenkins is hosted.
I need to build a vdproj on a jenkins machine (Windows Server 2012 R2)- which requires devenv.exe and not msbuild.

I have launched an ubuntu EC2 instance and tried to install Jenkins on it.
The main difference between 'with restart' and 'without restart' plugin installation is that you cannot upgrade or uninstall plugins without restart (because of the architectural choice made in Jenkins).
The build works locally (on my pc) and on Jenkins .
We faced difficulties with the com.offbytwo.jenkins Jenkins API accessing our Jenkins which has been updated from 2.152 to 2.154 last week, so we decided to return to the previous installed version, via that option in the configure Jenkins page.

If you are using Jenkins integration and your local works fine.
If your jenkins server Runs in different platform eg:- Local is Windows Jenkins is in Linux.
Generally it should   suffice to install Java 8 and download the jenkins.war and run it as a   standalone process or under an application server such as Apache   Tomcat.
ZFS-related JVM crashes: When Jenkins runs on a system detected as a   SunOS, it tries to load integration for advanced ZFS features using   the bundled libzfs.jar which maps calls from Java to native libzfs.so   routines provided by the host OS.
As the forks of Solaris legacy, including ZFS and later the   OpenZFS initiative evolved, many different binary function signatures   were provided by different host operating systems - and when Jenkins   libzfs.jar invoked the wrong signature, the whole JVM process crashed.
We are thinking to upgrade Jenkins to a new version of Jenkins.
If we upgrade Jenkins 2.x version does the old JobDSL work with Jenkins 2.x ?
We could upgrade our legacy JobsDSL to use latest JobsDSL so that it will work with 2.x Jenkins?
If we upgrade latest Jenkins and latest JobsDsl with that combo work ?

Try to add path which is same as the Jenkins path i.e in case of *unix, we have /var/lib/jenkins, so that Jenkins have access to it.
It occurred due to browsers not installed on Jenkins machine.
If not, you should probably modify your PATH in the global jenkins configuration - Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> Configure System -> under Global Properties, Environment Variables should be checked, PATH var added and it should contain the /code/ path (together with all the other paths).
There are additional environment variables which inherit in every build of your environment can be reviewed at Manage Jenkins -> System information .

Also, everytime when I run the jenkins pipeline, It must not use the old files that was cloned during last build.
On Jenkins I can see that he uses the new /code/ for project A, but all other files are untouched / from an older version.
Instead of escaping those in your command, you can use a different shell syntax from Jenkins: .
These two java application based on JDK1.6, add i also check jar file 's source code is JDK 1.6, so i use JDK 1.6 compile it /code/, one more thing is that, if i do n't replace this class file, it can build successfully in Jenkins, while once i update that class file it will fail.

Therefore how through Jenkins or with a special plugin we can refer to execute a job, to execute a set of /code/, where the project (workspace) is located in other PC?
The problem was that Jenkins uses it 's own cacerts file found in the Jenkins install folder.
Also I tried to run this using jenkins installed in my local machine.
But when I try using jenkins installed in linux server ang access it through my machine I cant make it work.
My local machine is on windows 7 and jenkins is installed in linux server.
/pre/  NOTE: I am using Jenkins version /code/ .
/pre/  So when you execute the script through Jenkins, the system tries to find the chrome driver in Jenkins machine.
In our environment, Cloudbee Pipeline is linked with Git repo ( where our Jenkins file is present) and inside that Jenkins file under environment section, GIT branch name is mentioned ( where our Project is mentioned).
Since it contains reserved char, you can set this property by creating a /url/ file $JENKINS_HOME/init.groovy, or any .groovy file in the directory $JENKINS_HOME/init.groovy.d/ containing: .
I do n't think Jenkins has native support for file conversion so it sounds like you would have to write some shell scripts to convert the files and then have Jenkins invoke these scripts.
/pre/  /pre/  The version number set in the Jenkins build environment is used by the /code/ command.
I 've noticed the files are stored at: /code/ Is there an option for Jenkins to delete the whole /code/ folder and only keep the /code/ folder?

/pre/  So you just need to put the /code/ into a directory and have Jenkins zip it.
I faced same issue while setting up jenkins, the problem is that java is not installed and hence not available in path.
The error /code/ hints Protractor is not installed on Jenkins slave machine where your protractor script resides, or Protractor is installed but not expand it to /code/ environment variable.
I have Jenkins (v2.163) installed and I 'm using the plugins email-ext as well as the token macro plugin.
I find the easiest way is to simply install the plugin manually and then look inside the 'plugins' directory in your Jenkins install and then look for the name of the directory that contains the relevant plugin - that will be the name to pass to Ansible.
I am a rookie to Jenkins trying to set up a Python pytest test suite to run.

In my case since jenkins is running on VM which is providing a Linux based system in Windows.
We cannot execute Windows Batch Command becuase jenkins is running on Linux based VM.
But it installs / starts an AVD in host (JENKINS_HOME), not the target node (another machine I use for automation related stuff).
How to tell the plugin / change its config to create / run the AVDs in target node (connected to jenkins via slave.jar)?
The plugin works fine in Jenkins version - 2.7.3 but, not on the higher or latest versions of Jenkins.
Then, I installed a new jenkins container and everything worked well for two weeks.
 Direct answer – make pre-install step in jenkins with /code/, and you 'll have it in /code/ .

i moved m2 out of jenkins home directory into /opt/m2 through maven configuration .
You have the old Jenkins version and probably the way to fix the issue is the installing of a new Jenkins (last LTE release).
You can backup /code/ file of your job (see /url/ answer) and then try upgrade or re-install the Jenkins.
Note: I prefer to not upgrade to the new version, but to do full re-installing (if you do n't have a lot of system and plugins configuration in your old Jenkins).
Our Jenkins and Fastfile unpack and unsign the development version of the app.
I want to add a custom path to my jenkins node path so that when I execute a /code/ command from a pipeline script it includes a given PATH directory.

I have to run the shell command which contains testng.xml if I run the same test from eclipse it runs perfectly but when I run it this test on  Jenkins the chrome browser is not launched and the test case fails.
And I also installed jenkins.
I faced a similar issue after I updated my Jenkins installation.
It seems that newer version of Jenkins do not include the jelly:util library, required for using the util tags.
I currently am working on unifying multiple Jenkins file that all build the same software project, with the same steps, but handle different versions, ie 2.4 vs 3.5, the key difference between versions being the SDK, and subsequently VM/Jenkins agent it runs on.
Running shell scripts that have contain sudo commands in them from jenkins might not run as expected.
Again, this works just as expected when run manually or trigerred from my machine via SSH, but when trigered from Jenkins (Added a build step /code/ which tries to SSH and launch the script) it doesnt work.
This works well but I am now considering how to run it from  within our Jenkins CI setup.
I know for a fact that the module has been updated in Nexus, because when I build this project through Jenkins, it fails because that method was moved.
Are those jobs, nodes or different jenkins installation?
When I run a build on the cluster where Jenkins is, it works fine, pulls the code, builds an image and all that.
Then copied from /var/jenkins_home/docker to /usr/bin using shell on docker container.
This is all managed on the YUM repo server using some home grown scripts to pull packages from Jenkins and put them into the JL-testing repo (replacing any old versions there).

I added it to my pre-build step on Jenkins installed on macOS.
/pre/  Workspace is the name of the Jenkins directory where the build is happening from.
In jenkins I have one build which is running on different envoironments.
I do n't want to give hardcoded absolute path of that SDK file like "/Users/jenkins/Documents/....", as on different machines that SDK folder can be in any path under Document root directory.
Such as /code/ (assuming your Jenkins build agent is Linux based) .
JENKINS_HOME 's default location is set to ~/.jenkins, but this can be changed by creating the Environment variable before the installation step.
