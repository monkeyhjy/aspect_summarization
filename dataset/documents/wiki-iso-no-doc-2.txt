TRAVIS-0
compatibility	1
The compatibility of the software with respect to specific platforms, programming languages, or other softwares	1
degree to which a product or system can effectively and efficiently be adapted for different or evolving hardware, software or other operational or usage environments	1
degree of effectiveness and efficiency with which a product or system can be successfully installed and/or uninstalled in a specified environment	1
degree to which a product can replace another specified software product for the same purpose in the same environment	1
learnability	2
The activities of the community maintaining the software (e.g., is the software actively maintained?)	2
The content/quality of the software documentation	2
degree to which users can recognize whether a product or system is appropriate for their needs. 	2
degree to which a product or system can be used by specified users to achieve specified goals of learning to use the product or system with effectiveness, efficiency, freedom from risk and satisfaction in a specified context of use	2
Function	3
Run tests locally	3
CI is intended to be used in combination with automated unit tests written through the practices of test-driven development. This is done by running and passing all unit tests in the developer's local environment before committing to the mainline. This helps avoid one developer's work-in-progress breaking another developer's copy. Where necessary, partially complete features can be disabled before committing, using feature toggles for instance.	3
Compile code in CI	3
A build server compiles the code periodically or even after every commit and reports the results to the developers. The use of build servers had been introduced outside the XP (extreme programming) community and many organisations have adopted CI without adopting all of XP.	3
Run tests in CI	3
In addition to automated unit tests, organisations using CI typically use a build server to implement continuous processes of applying quality control in general â€“ small pieces of effort, applied frequently. In addition to running the unit and integration tests, such processes run additional static analyses, measure and profile performance, extract and format documentation from the source code and facilitate manual QA processes. On the popular Travis CI service for open-source, only 58.64% of CI jobs execute tests.	3
This continuous application of quality control aims to improve the quality of software, and to reduce the time taken to deliver it, by replacing the traditional practice of applying quality control after completing all development. This is very similar to the original idea of integrating more frequently to make integration easier, only applied to QA processes.	3
Deploy an artifact from CI	3
Now, CI is often intertwined with continuous delivery or continuous deployment in what is called CI/CD pipeline. "Continuous delivery" makes sure the software checked in on the mainline is always in a state that can be deployed to users and "continuous deployment" makes the deployment process fully automated.	3
Performance	4
The performance of the software (e.g., speed, memory footprint)	4
degree to which the response and processing times and throughput rates of a product or system, when performing its functions, meet requirements	4
degree to which the amounts and types of resources used by a product or system, when performing its functions, meet requirements	4
degree to which the maximum limits of a product or system parameter meet requirements	4
Reliability	5
The reliability of the software (e.g., whether it is buggy or not)	5
degree to which a system, product or component meets needs for reliability under normal operation	5
degree to which a system, product or component is operational and accessible when required for use	5
degree to which a system, product or component operates as intended despite the presence of hardware or software faults	5
degree to which, in the event of an interruption or a failure, a product or system can recover the data directly affected and re-establish the desired state of the system	5
Usability	6
The usability of the software, in terms of how easy is to use/adapt it and evolve/maintain the code using it	6
degree to which a product or system has attributes that make it easy to operate and control	6
degree to which a user interface enables pleasing and satisfying interaction for the user	6
degree to which a system protects users against making errors	6
degree to which a product or system can be used by people with the widest range of characteristics and capabilities to achieve a specified goal in a specified context of use	6
