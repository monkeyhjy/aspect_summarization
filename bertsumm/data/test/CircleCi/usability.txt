Negative:
but in my circleci 2.0 server only the first job, build runs while test and android do n't run although they are part of the overall workflow config.
i ca n't seem to figure out how to override/extend the orb to run additionally circleci equivalent of  .
i 'm trying to get reporting working for karate dsl, and it 's proven a challenge because my team uses circleci instead of jenkins.
i 'm having trouble trying to get my elixir/phoenix app on circleci.
i 'm struggling to configure the /code_segment/ postgres config in my circleci configuration file.
i 'm currently trying to get gobuffalo and circleci working, but so far without luck.
but the circleci configuration does not work because it uses maven commands.
i 've used a ci like circleci before, but that was a terrible experience as they were transitioning from circleci 1.0 to 2.0 and the specific setup i was using was largely devoid of material.
i can only guess that circleci had some other use case in mind for their introduction of pipeline variables because this is just not very convenient.

Positive:
to really take advantage of circleci though, you might want to try doing it like this: .
we use circleci, so firing these commands should n't be a big deal.
it 's even easier with a tool like circleci.

i am using circleci for ci and saucelabs for automated testing.
circleci convenience images (the pre-built images you refer to) are designed to be a starting point for the majority of circleci users.
it works for us as it only sends a job status in our #build channel on slack, with a visual green or red bar and a link to visit the circleci page .
it integrates automatically with circleci 's parallelism env variables.
works great in 2.0 circleci config.
turning off the redundant build setting on circleci seems like the best bet.
for convenience, circleci maintains several docker images.
alternatively, you can set up relatively simple ci/cd inside github actions, circleci or travisci and build in multiple xcode versions at the same time there.
