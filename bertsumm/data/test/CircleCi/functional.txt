Negative:
i 'm trying to configure dockerfile in order to build a docker image of my api and deploy it to heroku using circleci, but cannot seem to properly configure it for https.
i 'm pushing my code to github and when i merge my branch, it kicks off a a build in circleci.
i 've done the sending message to slack part, but now circleci sends a message to slack every time i push.

Positive:
you can also see how i build an android app from just the project source files, some gradle properties and dependency files, on circleci system via command line instructions in this yml file.
as far as ci/cd, since our deployment is pretty much just a docker push, we 've used circleci without any issues.
in my case, i use jenkins, artifactory, github, circleci, and for legacy reasons perforce, to manage a code tree of 70k+ files ( code tree not my design!)
circleci allowed adding 'ssh permissions' to a project, so as during setting up build to run, it attaches that to the environment, thus making any ssh commands to the vps easy.
if you already added your keys as environment variables in circleci, they are already available for your build jobs.
we have a number of applications that are built and released via circleci.
we are using github + circleci + heroku with automatic deploys setup.
/pre/  using tar_options environment to inject the option /code_segment/ allowed circleci to extract the tarball without issue.
when first added via the ui, circleci only looks at master, but subsequent pushes to any branch (as long as .circleci/config.yml is present in that branch) should work.
it must work in this way, that when i merge pull request on git, then my pipeline launch docker image build and run test within this docker, here is my circleci config file: .
i 'm using firebase to host my personal website and wanted to integrate circleci for faster integration.
iâ€™m trying to introduce some automation via circleci where it will go into the server made in digitalocean via ssh in order to put in commands for updating said server.
circleci does, there you can store some content to read on next jobs, but on github actions i ca n't.
