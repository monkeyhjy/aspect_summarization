Negative:
i have also tried the teamcity automatic merge feature but the only guides you can find is how to merge from some branch specification to a fixed branch eg integration branch.
so i can only assume it is running the pull request against master based on the text above, however i ca n't seem to find any documentation to indicate this.
i could n't find any information on how to do this for  reports generated in teamcity.
a teamcity config i 'm missing (there is no specific documentation on the teamcity or cypress side regarding a teamcity/cypress integration that i can find) .
i see hardly any examples for this configuration on teamcity.
but i ca n't find any examples how to use the token in regards to npm login alone or via teamcity?
i 've previously asked this on the teamcity forum but did n't get a reply.
firstly you right teamcity documentation is not clear.
teamcity 's documentation link is broken atm of writing this.

Positive:
i 've been learning teamcity the last couple of weeks and have had some good success (fun!).
the documentation of teamcity explains how to download builded artifacts by using the tag version.
answered over on the teamcity support forums; .
lots of people seem to be having problems with tc automerge setups, so here is the complete answer i posted on the teamcity community forum.
i searched and read about the build breaker, but its already supported with sonarqube plugin of teamcity as this document /url/  .
more details could be found in teamcity documentation on vcs checkout mode.
you can find the full teamcity artifact dependency documentation here .
talking with teamcity support i was able to figure it out.
i 've found one similar post on the teamcity community forum, where /url/ , and the symptoms sound very similar.
i would highly recommend looking at the teamcity node plugin available at /url/.
see documentation for details on how to generate access token in teamcity.
(see the agent setup heading in the teamcity setup documentation for gitversion which explains this).
i asked this question on teamcity issues tracker and they said it will be fixed in version 2020.1 .
