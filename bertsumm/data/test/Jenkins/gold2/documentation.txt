Negative:
Jenkins' documentation can be often misleading, irrelevant, no referable, useless on the Jenkins pylint warnings tool, 
complicated on freakin and doesn' t have any examples to configure github actions to trigger Jenkins job.

Positive:
Jenkins' documentation is available on how to setup slave, bitbucket, pipeline, difference between quotes in groovy, directory structure and defining custom steps.
The full list of available system properties is on the Jenkins wiki.
Jenkins dragas' solution is almost correct.
The job name and number can be easily seen on Jenkins' main page.
