Negative:
Debugging, loading, test of Jenkins and links of between all nodes in Jenkins cluster are very slow.
Jenkins consumes cpu to max and this is why Jenkins dies.
Application getting built on Jenkins server can run slowly.
Nuget restore runs very slowly through Jenkins pipeline.

Positive:
Using Jenkins to config, merge and present the test result can save time.
