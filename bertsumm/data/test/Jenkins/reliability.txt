actually there are couple of unresolved bugs with groovy closures in jenkins pipelines, for example /url/ and /url/.
so, seemingly, an error code is not returned to jenkins.

i can connect to jenkins via 8080 port and everything works fine, however, when a new job is triggered, just when the job starts building (second stage) the connection to jenkins is broken and can nor connect to port 8080 anymore unless jenkins is restarted in the terminal.

Positive:
jenkins issues /url/ and /url/ detail potential fixes that could be introduced, though they have n't been implemented in any version of the system yet.
