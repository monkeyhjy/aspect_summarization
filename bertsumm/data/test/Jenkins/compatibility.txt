Negative:
so there should be a revert process so that we can revert back to older working version of jenkins.
the command to run test suites on cmd works fine when jenkins is on local server but fails when i run the same command on jenkins on aws linux instance?
/pre/  but the problem is on the jenkins cluster that i will run my project build on, it does n't support python 3.7.
i 'm on windows so i already had to resolve the problem of jenkins not finding any sh and nohup exes (installed git bash because it apparently did not want to work with my cygwin install).
this plugin has not been updated in a few years, so i 'm not sure if it 's compatible with the latest version of jenkins.
for jenkins environments which have macos, windows, or other agents, which are unable to run the docker daemon, this default setting may be problematic.
i am using jenkins version 2.222.4 and trying to install sonarscanner for msbuild - .net fwk 5.0.0 from global tool configuration but i could n't find the required version in the available list of versions in 'install from github' drop down list.
however using httprequest from jenkins inbuild library is still not working.
the outdated groovy in jenkins does n't support null-safe navigation on lists, so you have to do it old-school.

Positive:
it seems aws jenkins is opened with palo alto firewall, so i am able to access the url from the aws unix box where jenkins is installed and not from the jenkins application.
in virtually all resources online people just install .net core cli using apt-get (or different app management tools) on the jenkins machine directly.
i have configured for other projects to publish the .net project using jenkins and they all worked well.
jenkins probably works best when the project is structured along standard lines (as the most vanilla example take a makefile/gcc project on linux with a git repo).
/pre/  if you have installed git on your jenkins (which i truly believe) you can simply execute this as bash / sh command or using jenkins' echo if you want to display it.
i have a simple jenkins job  ( jenkins 1.514  ) and i隆炉m looking for a way that every time job is running it will refresh a specific system environment variable.
the latest jenkins has pipeline support.
we already have plugins installed for the bitbucket server and sonarqube in jenkins and we ran the sonar using this command in the jenkinsfile .
i am able to solve this by installing locally-hosted jenkins on my
jenkins file loads libraries from different repository but located on the same git account and it was working fine.
as jenkins supports the jdk (8,11) version.
