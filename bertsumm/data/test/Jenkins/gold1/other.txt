Negative:
having issue running ant via jenkins pipeline.
issues like no build is triggered on jenkins, wrong actual jenkins build number.

Positive:
restart jenkins will do the job.
There is a "fork" of Jenkins for containerized environments.
all of this as well can automated in a jenkins pipeline
