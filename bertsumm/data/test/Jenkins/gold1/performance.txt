Negative:
it takes long time for loading configuration page and data, saving artifacts, executing jenkins job, running nuget restore and building application using jenkins.
jenkins seem to consume cpu to max when 4 build job are running.
jenkins 's memory consumption can substantially increase when log every message. 

Positive:
use jenkins to config k8s on how many 'automations' run in-parallel to save time.
