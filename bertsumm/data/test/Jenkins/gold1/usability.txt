Negative:
jenkins ui (gui) is stupid for it blocks when update jenkins job config, unavailable buttons, takeing minutes to load and not showing important informations. 
unable to execute selenium scripts and see any plugins in jenkins.
jenkins features are not user friendly for keeping status files in different directories, turning simple git clone or checkout into many statements and hard to restart jenkins after updates.

Positive:
jenkins is easy to use when installing plugins via a shell script, automated deploying without any click, setting up multiple tasks for each pr, automating build process, starting up a jenkins instance, creating jenkins shared library with few steps.
semi-configured jenkins, readjson jenkins dsl, jenkins' standard methods and jenkins plugin are convenient. 
jenkins can be customized at will.
