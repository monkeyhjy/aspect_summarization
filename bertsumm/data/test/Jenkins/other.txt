Negative:
i am currently setting up a ci-pipeline with jenkins/sonarqube/maven/owasp, but im stuck in a sonarqube problem.
i am having issue running ant via jenkins pipeline.
but no build is triggered on jenkins.
/pre/  i always get the output as /code_segment/ and not the actual jenkins build number.
i am switching from jenkins to circle ci (embarrassed that it has taken this long to get of jenkins).

Positive:
but restart jenkins deamon using systemctl restart jenkins will do the job.
there is also a "fork" of jenkins for containerized environments, that i like, you can check more about jenkins-x here .
when i log into the jenkins build server directly and run from bash this works.
all of this as well can automated in a jenkins pipeline or with other continous deployment tools like circleci etc.
/pre/  but still on the jenkins, it is showing the build is successful.
