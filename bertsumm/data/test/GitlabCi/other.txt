Negative:

Positive:
i have a .gitlabci.yml in my master branch, it works fine everytime i push to master the ci pipeline runs.
so, i 'd like to switch to a ci-pipeline and i think travis-ci or gitlabci might be some good choices.
it works everywhere: in azure-pipelines.yaml and in gitlabci.yml and locally.
there 's an abundance of tools avilable.. jenkins, cicleci, travisci, droneci, gitlabci, bitbucketci, etc.
so, i 'd like to switch to a ci-pipeline and i think travis-ci or gitlabci might be some good choices.
