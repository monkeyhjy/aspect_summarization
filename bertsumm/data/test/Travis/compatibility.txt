Negative:
i came across to this issue while upgrading travis distribution from 14.04 to 16.04 and python 3.6 started to fail.
it seems that the setuptools package provided by travis-ci for python 3.6 is too old to use the /code_segment/ specifier correctly.
it is telling you that python 3.1 is not a version that travis supports, please try a newer version like .ci allows to configure environment variables, so you can store the private key into a environment variable, i.e /code_segment/ .
i 'm trying to make travis run on all python versions, now my scripts run over: python 2.7, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 but not over python 3.8.
it is telling you that python 3.1 is not a version that travis supports, please try a newer version like .
my travis build keeps failing because apparently it does not recognize the arm abi.
currently, travis tries to upload it trice (once for python 3.4, python 3.5 and python 3.6, respectively), and thus two out of three builds fail.
because travis-ci native windows support for go seems to be lacking, i though about going this route.
i get to /code_segment/ line in the travis build and it waits until timeout.
i am having some issues getting travis-ci to install rcpparmadillo on ubuntu 16.04 with r-oldrel (3.5.3) although it works for r-release (3.6.1) and r-devel.
so far all windows builds are fine, but the linux and macos builds on azure pipeline and travis ci are not, for example here is a /url/, and message /code_segment/ .
/pre/  this works fine on my local ubuntu machine, but the resulting archives are empty when build on travis ci.
i having some troubles to make puppeteer with jasmine works in travis-ci like in my loca repo.
i'm trying to install travis on ubuntu but keeps failing.
edit: the build is still failing in travis, but locally and in the travis debug environment it succeeds: .
i am using appveyor (think travis but for windows) to run some tests again several different versions of python.
since a few days travis does not support the jdk option oraclejdk10 anymore.
it seems we ca n't specify version to install in travis-ci.
this worked on windows (using pycharm 's virtual automated environment) but does not work on linux and of course not on travis ci virtual machines.
what worked was to use pyenv, but on the ubuntu xenial dist provided by travis, the shipped version of pyenv was too old and did n't have python 3.7 available.
(older versions of php are n't unit tested because travis ci does n't support them; docker containers could be used but yeh) .
but unfortunately my travis matrix brakes, because on some older python versions (3.5 - 3.7)
this works fine on my local machine (windows 10), but fails when it 's run on travis.

Positive:
travis ci can be built without any preinstalled /code_segment/ compilers (e.g.
if your problem is travisci related then you can set a fixed version which works: .
listed supported ios simulator sdk on travis  .
it looks superficially similar to yours, and works perfectly well on both ubuntu (travis-ci) and my local macbook pro for myself.
since travis has good support for docker this is straight forward.
/pre/  this works seamlessly in local environment using python 3.7 and in travis-ci environment using python 3.5.
i am running a travis build with multiple os.
/pre/  the code runs successful on different machines, python3.x versions and travis.
travis ci runs each build in a separate virtualenv against the python versions described in the yml file.
/pre/  i read about every single article on how to setup codecov with jacoco and travis ci, made a detour via cobertura just to figure out that java10 is not supported and read change logs to see if some versions are uncompatible.
i personally use travis to test my software hosted on github and it supports running on multiple architectures [1], including s390x which is big endian.
travis allows us to specify os versions etc but i do not know if we can have a server with anaconda preinstalled from a dockerfile, instead of writing the installation script within .travis.yml.
find a recent travis ci image in docker hub matching your target os as closely as possible.
portable (i switched from travis ci with the same approach easily) .
i 'm using travis to test python code on various versions and architectures.
i tried manually and i found travis supports clickhouse, the way below worked out for me.
