positive:
"z3 folks do maintain nightly-builds on github, so it is indeed possible to pull the latest code and integrate it with travis-ci (for linux and mac) and also appveyor (for windows)."
travis ci provides a way to cache maven repository.
negative:
"i 'm trying to work with travis ci, and previously i have try to build my project in the android studio 's terminal with ./gradlew build or with ./gradlew clean build but both throws ""execution failed for task ':presentation:compilereleasekotlin'."""
i was trying to setup travis for my github project but run into some problems (see ss).
