positive:
"firefox 65+ supports a new /code_segment/ about:config preference, which you can set to true to make the console output be dumped to stdout (and appear in travis, i believe)."
"i personally use travis to test my software hosted on github and it supports running on multiple architectures [1], including s390x which is big endian."
negative:
i was n't able to install travis using ruby that comes builtin with xcode command line developer tools but installing ruby using brew install ruby followed by /code_segment/ resulted in a successful travis installation.
"what worked was to use pyenv, but on the ubuntu xenial dist provided by travis, the shipped version of pyenv was too old and did n't have python 3.7 available."
