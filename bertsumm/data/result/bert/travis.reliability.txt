positive:
the travis build looks ok and i ca n't see any errors.
"my last ""passed"" commit, according to travis ci, was literally a typo change so the library 's code should not be the problem; so, when i run /code_segment/ for the library, i get the nice r cmd check succeeded message with 0 errors, warnings, or notes."
negative:
"whenever i try to test it on travis-ci, the infinite loop portion draws an error even though the file builds correctly since it is running infinitely."
"but if mysql is starting from scratch (that 's the cases on travis), mysql needs some time to initialize accounts, database, configurations etc., and trying to connect during this leads to an error."
