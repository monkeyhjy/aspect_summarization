positive:
when i run the jenkins build it is not generating any apk at jenkins workspace.
i encounter this kind of problem on gcp, jenkins master behind load balance, almost the same as sidharth ramesh reply.
once commit is done on github, jenkins able to detect the new commit, but unable to fetch the new code changes and throws the below output.
negative:
when my jenkins automation detects change on push to branch, it analyses which files where changed from which module.
i 'm automating the jenkins installation along with plugin installation.as part of that i want to get the suggested plugins from jenkins server itself or install the same via api or cli instead of passing a list of plugins manually .
