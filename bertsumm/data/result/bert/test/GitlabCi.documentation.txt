positive:
now, i have seen that we can use "gitlabci" even for private repositories but i am having trouble understanding the "shared runners" concept.
for security reasons i need to set up protected enviroment variables in gitlabci/cd, the problem is that in the documentation only mentions how to use inside the .gitlabci.yml file,  but not in the index.js.
may anyone has a solution for that because i did n't find anything in the gitlabci docs.
negative:
a general introduction to gitlabci using docker can be found in this blog article (the first slides are great).
an ease example of gitlabci file to run the test in the ci: .
