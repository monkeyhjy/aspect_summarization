positive:
the problem is i need to build those projects parallelly in gitlabci pipeline when there is a code push and i cant hardcode them in .gitlabci.yml as they are generated on fly.
but then i wanted to integrate the shell script in our gitlabci/cd pipeline and for some reason when i run git blame on gitlab, all lines are attributed to me and the latest commit.
so, can someone please explain why gitlabci is missing an obvious feature (which is n't available even in ee) that has been in bamboo and hudson/jenkins for decades?
- i ensure, that the line running the python script always returns a 0 exit code such, that gitlabci does not stop executing the next lines, but i remember the status code
negative:
i 'm using the gitlab release api in the gitlabci.yml to be able to automatically create a new release when deploying.
the tricky part is gitlabci can even clone repository into docker container automatically.
