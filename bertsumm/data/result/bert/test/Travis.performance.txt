positive:
not even talking about the travis build that runs forever.
when i 'm trying to upload files to the server using this command it takes 1-2 minutes, but travis cannot do it at all.
negative:
currently all drill unit tests can't pass with 8g memory machines, which used as ci (travisci and circleci): /url/
i have found travis are quite quick to respond but you'll also need to set up your commandline client: .
travis ci keeps a cache of your vendor folder in order to make builds run quicker (and reduce unnecessary traffic for them).
