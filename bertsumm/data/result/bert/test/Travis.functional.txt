positive:
this may mean giving up some handy travis feature in favor of re-coding it yourself.
however, when i try to automate deployment using travis, after deploying, i am unable to access the application and i get a 404 when accessing the link.
negative:
i think it is a problem because on travis-ci it needs to grab the dependencies and since these dependencies do not use semantic versioning, go grabs the latest, which changes on every commit to master.
travis ci can test multiple versions of php per trigger.
