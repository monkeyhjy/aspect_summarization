positive:
but i got stuck when i deploy the application using gitlabci where it seems that mongo server does n't start at test environment on gitlab runner.
i 'm struggling to understand the difference between my workstation environment and the gitlabci docker environment.
negative:
script is executing in gitlabci linux runner, image based on golang and works fine without extension.
i have configured .gitlabci.yml file, and using ci lint it has passed the validation process.
