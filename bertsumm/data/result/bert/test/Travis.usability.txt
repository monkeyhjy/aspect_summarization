positive:
i want to make the package compatible with travis ci, however, as a newbie, struggle to set up the version correctly.
travis encrypts environment variables and does not make them available to forks.
negative:
travis ci can automatically deploy your heroku application after a successful build.
if you are just trying to add travis ci so that it has access to your personal repositories but not to the organizations you administer, you can do so easily.
