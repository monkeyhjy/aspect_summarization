positive:
i 've build a test scenario for gitlab (.gitlabci.yml) but i 've issue for some tests as they need to have an access on public ressources (provided by internet without limitation but specific url + port).
i can able to set the ci runner for windows but unable configure the gitlabci runner with cmd executor and by defaultci runner executor is power shell ise .
negative:
if you have 3 tasks which can be merged into one and what you want to achieve is only to have 3 separated functions running in the same container to make the .gitlabci.yml file easier to understand, i would recommend using yaml anchors (see below).
i was able to get my pipelines to create after removing some configuration from my .gitlabci.yml file.
