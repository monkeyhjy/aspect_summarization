positive:
"since i have no issue creating and serving the gzipped webpack bundle locally and in a test environment, i expect them to work in circleci."
i was able to get cd working on circleci with my unity project.
negative:
"if i am running on my own machine it will work since i have .m2 folder that has the missing jar, but when running on a new machine (circleci) it fails."
it looks like like if i use the latest version of pandoc (2.9.1.1) everything will work fine but i ca n't seem to get circleci to download the latest version.
