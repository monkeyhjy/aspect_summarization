positive:
"if you have a huge .gitlabci.yml file, you might be able to use yaml anchors or the extends keyword to reuse part of your script without having to depend on the variable expansion."
"since there is only one gitlabci.yml file, i can define many jobs to be executed one after the other sequentially."
negative:
"i have already seen this stack-overflow page, but it does not help because my job needs to be triggered by either of 2 conditions which is not allowed bit gitlabci."
i am running /code_segment/ on gitlabci and from time to time the test is failing without log .
