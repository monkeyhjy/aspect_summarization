positive:
disclaimer: developer advocate at circleci .
"docker is applying pull rate limit as of nov 1st, so it would be a good idea to authenticate before the pull, see docker auth on circleci for a tip."
negative:
i have been googling for some hours and still did n't get stuff clear on how i can integrate karate with circleci.
"when i read one way in the circleci documentation, i see another example that does n't use the configuration in the docs, but claim that it works."
