negative:
i have several build configurations on teamcity and the other configurations ignore tests when i use compiler directives like in the example below.
"i was surpised as this was only from march 2019 on the jetbrains site, and the instructions do n't seem to work, i am quite familiar with teamcity, using it every day for the last 8 years, but i 'm not at all familiar with google cloud, so i need some pointers or instruction on how to do this... ."
