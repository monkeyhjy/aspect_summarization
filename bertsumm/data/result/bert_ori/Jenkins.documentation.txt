"when it comes to aggregates build times group by job, i could n't find anything good within jenkins ui, but if you have a datadog license, you can just enable the datadog jenkins plugin, configure the datadog api key and hostname in jenkins config, and you are good to go."
you can refer to this stackoverflow post or jobs as code with groovy dsl to learn more about jenkins job dsl.
