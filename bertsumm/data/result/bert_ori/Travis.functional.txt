positive:
i 'm trying to build a ci process with an automatic upload of release artifacts to maven central (sonatype) from github using travis ci.
"this is pretty easy for repos i 've integrated with travis-ci, because i can just go down the list rerunning the most recent builds, which culminate in pushes to /code_segment/ branches, which in turn cause pages servers to rebuild."
negative:
"then however after i checked my code into github, the build servers of azure pipeline, appveyor and travis ci are not happy, they complain that my ""plugin.json"" file is not found."
"since this issue does not happen locally (windows machine), i have to build the html locally and then push the source code to github, which defeats the purpose of having the travis-ci pipeline."
