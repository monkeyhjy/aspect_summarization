positive:
it is a little bit of a pain, but after doing that, i was able to continue installing teamcity .
after am upgrade of the svn verion (it was something old like 1.6.x) to a new svn version, the step 4 is always blocking (the teamcity server shows building step 'mkdir' forever) .
negative:
i updated to the latest teamcity on this machine, transferred my backup file, and the build seems to be working perfectly - it seems to be somehow caused by the latest version of visual studio.
without installing additional software, teamcity servers and build   agents can interact with team foundation servers (from 2010 to 2017;   2018 is supported since teamcity 2017.2) and visual studio team   services.
