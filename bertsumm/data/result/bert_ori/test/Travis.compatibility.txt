positive:
my travis build keeps failing because apparently it does not recognize the arm abi.
i am having some issues getting travis-ci to install rcpparmadillo on ubuntu 16.04 with r-oldrel (3.5.3) although it works for r-release (3.6.1) and r-devel.
what worked was to use pyenv, but on the ubuntu xenial dist provided by travis, the shipped version of pyenv was too old and did n't have python 3.7 available.
negative:
/pre/  this works seamlessly in local environment using python 3.7 and in travis-ci environment using python 3.5.
i personally use travis to test my software hosted on github and it supports running on multiple architectures [1], including s390x which is big endian.
