positive:
as far as i know, there is no ready to use plugin or integration for gitlabci and jira.
/pre/  i want to build projecct in gitlabci , but this yml to need install xctool , so if i install xctool must to install brew , but i do n't know how to install brew in this .
negative:
script is executing in gitlabci linux runner, image based on golang and works fine without extension.
here is a working example of a job in a .gitlabci with a loop running on gnu/linux os and using sh/bash shell : .
i have configured .gitlabci.yml file, and using ci lint it has passed the validation process.
i can update version in wrapper and forget about version in ci(in gitlabci.yml)
i 'm currently migrating our ci/cd pipeline from a bitbucket/jenkins environment to hosted gitlab with additional custom gitlabci runners.
