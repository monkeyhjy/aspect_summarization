positive:
after spending all day trying to figure out what was wrong and after trying several combinations of configs, and reading a lot of questions on stackoverflow and reading documentation, i narrowed down the issue to the serverless python requirements plugin which appears to be having some kind of incompatibility issue with the python instance on the image from circleci.
there is no way to share maven builds across different projects in circleci.
negative:
on the local machine, when you run circleci, everything passes.
on circleci, all 3 jars are installed correctly.
solution: in order to run both a go and python server in the same circleci job, we created a custom docker image that combines the public circleci golang and python images.
i was able to get cd working on circleci with my unity project.
call circleci predefined images such as ruby, openjdk.
