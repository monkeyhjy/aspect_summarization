positive:
but when it comes to the freakin jenkins jobs it seems to get a bit more complicated.
i could find no reference to /code_segment/ in the jenkins documentation, so i created a build to try to clarify their relationship.
i have consulted the jenkins docs and while i see that db connections are possible, i have not yet found anything which fits my needs.
negative:
i 've installed jenkins x on eks using instructions from /url/ so that i can use bitbucket with jira.
the documentation explains how to use it in a jenkins pipeline with the triggerremotejob step.
