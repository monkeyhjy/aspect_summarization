positive:
this may mean giving up some handy travis feature in favor of re-coding it yourself.
i'm trying to deploy our app through travis cli, the build is getting build perfectly, but when it comes to deploy, it deploys the whole root app folder.
negative:
i have the /url/ file, which starts automatic test on travis-ci, on each push on github.
i've discovered a neat way to use travis to deploy to the gh-pages branch (involving a token and a gem to encrypt it) of a repo, which actually makes it a subdomain of my website.
