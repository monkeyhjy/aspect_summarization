positive:
i have been trying to set up a teamcity instance in docker, and when i try to migrate from the internal db - which i successfully removed - teamcity does n't find the jdbc driver for postgresql with the error: /code_segment/
you could disable to step in teamcity leaving it for reference should you run into the issue again.
negative:
because i could imagine that teamcity employs some sort of safeguard mechanism that prevents certain changes on the server it 's run from.
this was a bug, which is fixed in teamcity 2018.1.3.
