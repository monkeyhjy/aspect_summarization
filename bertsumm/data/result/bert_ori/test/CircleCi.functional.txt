positive:
i 'm trying to configure dockerfile in order to build a docker image of my api and deploy it to heroku using circleci, but cannot seem to properly configure it for https.
i 'm pushing my code to github and when i merge my branch, it kicks off a a build in circleci.
negative:
you can also see how i build an android app from just the project source files, some gradle properties and dependency files, on circleci system via command line instructions in this yml file.
we have a number of applications that are built and released via circleci.
when first added via the ui, circleci only looks at master, but subsequent pushes to any branch (as long as .circleci/config.yml is present in that branch) should work.
