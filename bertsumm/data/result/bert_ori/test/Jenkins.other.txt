positive:
i am having issue running ant via jenkins pipeline.
but no build is triggered on jenkins.
/pre/  i always get the output as /code_segment/ and not the actual jenkins build number.
i am switching from jenkins to circle ci (embarrassed that it has taken this long to get of jenkins).
negative:
there is also a "fork" of jenkins for containerized environments, that i like, you can check more about jenkins-x here .
when i log into the jenkins build server directly and run from bash this works.
/pre/  but still on the jenkins, it is showing the build is successful.
