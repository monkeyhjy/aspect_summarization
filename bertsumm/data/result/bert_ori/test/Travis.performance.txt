positive:
not even talking about the travis build that runs forever.
when i 'm trying to upload files to the server using this command it takes 1-2 minutes, but travis cannot do it at all.
negative:
if you don't need this precision, use the travis solution because it will be faster.
travis ci keeps a cache of your vendor folder in order to make builds run quicker (and reduce unnecessary traffic for them).
