positive:
this is awkward on our teamcity build server where i would like a build configuration for each shared library/project and have my application use artifact dependencies to reference the dlls the build server generates.
another solution would be to leverage a continuous integration tool such as jenkins or teamcity to automatically schedule runs over a period of time.
negative:
i have been searching a lot for ways to auto merge the target git branch into a feature branch in a pull request every time the target branch is updated with bitbucket server and teamcity.
i am using teamcity 's out-of-the-box powershell  build runner to run script provided in the build step.
