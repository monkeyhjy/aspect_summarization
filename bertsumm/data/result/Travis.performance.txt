['"i \'ve so far tried both appveyor and travis, but each time the build stops with virtualbox reporting /code_segment/, and it just looks like whatever machine i \'m running vboxmanage on does n\'t have vt-x enabled."']
["i 'm trying to set up travis ci for tests but when i get to the step to compile the code to javascript (tsc command) it fails."]
["my time zone does n't recognize dst and i get the same result as travis ci."]
