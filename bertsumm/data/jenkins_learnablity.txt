Download the /code/ file (from the node 's page of Jenkins) .
If it cannot be used, my apologies, Jenkins' documentation is often misleading.
You Can refer to /url/ which shows how to setup slave for jenkins .
/url/ This is the link to the documentation for this by jenkins, but I do n't find a hint for my problem.

I have created a shared Library in Jenkins which looks something like this (simplified version): .
I 've installed Jenkins X on EKS using instructions from /url/ so that I can use BitBucket with Jira.
The /url/ properties is on the Jenkins Wiki.
I have used this guide to "install" jenkins on my local machine: .
This stackoverflow page can help you checkout bitbucket pull requests in Jenkins with Generic webhook trigger.
This plugin may be added in Jenkins by default in near future, /url/.
